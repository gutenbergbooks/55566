<h2><a name="authorsnote" id="authorsnote"></a><i>Author&rsquo;s Note</i></h2>
</div>


<p><span class="dropcap">B</span>EFORE dipping into this book very
far, reader (pray note that I cozen you
with neither &ldquo;gentle&rdquo; nor &ldquo;dear&rdquo;),
allow me to suggest that you familiarize yourself
with the spirit of Emerson, who has allowed
that the truly consistent person changes
his mind whenever occasion offers. Then you
will be in a frame of mind to acknowledge
that I have but exercised my privilege if you
chance upon passages that seem to put me in
a self-contradictory position. I hold to one
opinion till new or increased light shows me
I would do well to change, no longer.</p>

<p>Is it necessary, I wonder, to say that this
compilation of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">persiflage</i> and cookery is not
intended to be the whole culinary library of
any housekeeper? In case it may be believed
that I have any such inflated idea of its value,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>viii]</a></span>
let me say at once that any housekeeper who
secures this book, by buying or by borrowing,
will want just as many of the old-line &ldquo;cook-books&rdquo;
at hand as if she had never heard of
it. Its mission is a supplementary one.
It is for those dark and dreary days when the
housekeeper &ldquo;wants something good,&rdquo; but cannot
say what. It suggests. Therein is all of
beauty and use, for &ldquo;beauty is truth, truth
beauty, that is all ye know and all ye need
to know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Furthermore, it is for the housekeeper who
knows by experience, or intuition, how to
lay a fire, and how to broil a steak. With
kindergarten methods it does not deal&mdash;it
rather takes it for granted that it will fall into
the hands of those who have been graduated
from kindergarten cookery. Neither does it
attempt to set forth the duties of butlers or of
housemaids. It goes on the principle rather
that the housekeeper who supports these factotums
knows what their duties should be.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>ix]</a></span>
And is there any necessity for those who cannot
attain to such appointments burdening
their minds with knowledge never to be used?
Think on all these things omitted when you
are getting inspiration from this slender
source, and be thankful that I have shown
so much consideration for you.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">S</span>OME fine day, perchance, I shall to market
go and find there what all housekeepers
are &ldquo;a-sighin&rsquo; and a-cryin&rsquo; for&rdquo;&mdash;namely
a new edible; and be it fish, flesh,
or fowl, I shall, with all haste, make you acquainted
with its nature, and with the name
of the marketman who introduces the boon;
and methinks that nothing short of canonization
should reward the man, or woman, who
finds &ldquo;something new under the sun.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But till that blessed day of discovery really
arrives I must be content with telling you of
ways that may be new and tricks that are
worth trying for the serving of viands which
have constituted human nature&rsquo;s daily food
since the world began. Unless, however, I
can bring to your minds by my suggestions a
state of contentment which will enable you to
await that hour of revealment with patience
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>2]</a></span>
almost amounting to indifference, my duty is
but half done.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sausages</div>

<p>So here goes for a beginning. Don&rsquo;t you
ever feel quite dissatisfied with the ordinary,
yes and the extraordinary, sausages of commerce?
Of course you do. No need to ask.
They are flat, there&rsquo;s no gainsaying it. But
it&rsquo;s the easiest thing in the world to have
home-made sausages seasoned to a point that
will make them things of gastronomical joy.
There must be equal quantities of lean and
fat fresh pork finely minced; then to a pound
of this meat add one-quarter of an ounce of
salt, more or less, one-eighth of an ounce of
good business-like pepper, more or less, and
powdered sage <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ad lib.</i> The use of seasoning,
you see, is not bound by any hard and
fast rules; in cases of this kind a due regard
must be shown the whims and fancies of the
palates to be pleased. Once you have added
the proper amount of seasoning, add enough
well beaten egg to allow of the mixture being
moulded to any desired shape, and fried to
a nice brown. And there you have a dish
fit to put before a king. If the simplicity
and homeliness of it somewhat upsets your
equilibrium, why call it saucisses grill&eacute;es;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>3]</a></span>
they&rsquo;ll taste just as well. They can be served
either upon rounds of toasted bread or upon
a foundation of cold boiled potatoes which
have been diced and heated in cream.</p>

<p>If you are having them for luncheon then
serve them on toast, but with the addition of
a tomato pur&eacute;e. No need to tell how to make
that; it&rsquo;s an old story.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Broiled Pork
Chops<br />
<br />
Piquant
Sauce</div>

<p>Another old story, altogether too old, is the
way most housekeepers have of frying pork
chops. They should never be fried. The
only respectable way is to broil them decently
and in order over a hot bed of coals. In that
way what little juice they contain will be retained.
But even then they will be so dry
that you must supplement them with something,&mdash;say
a sauce made of half a pint of
good clear stock, highly seasoned, and having
in it a tablespoonful of chopped pickled peppers
and some sliced gherkins, with the juice
of a lemon added.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Apple
Croquettes</div>

<p>Or, you can serve with them apple croquettes,
made by stewing the apples in a little
butter, with a tiny bit of sugar; when quite
cold, with the aid of a few bread-crumbs, shape
the apple into croquettes, roll them in crumbs
and beaten egg and fry. Arrange the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>4]</a></span>
croquettes, which must be not more than an inch
in diameter, with the chops upon a platter
in any fanciful way that suggests itself to you,
and the condition of the platter at the end of
the meal will tell you whether or not the experiment
was worth the trying.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Roasted Pork
with Onion
Sauce</div>

<p>These croquettes will win favor for themselves
if you will try serving them some time
with a loin of fresh pork, roasted. You will
want to serve with them only the simplest kind
of clear gravy. But you may prefer to serve
the roasted loin of pork on steamed rice garnished
with button onions, which have been
boiled till fairly tender and then fried in butter
to a light brown. If this is your preference,
make a sauce by frying in two gills of oil,
half a pound of minced onion, a pinch of parsley
leaves, a crushed clove of garlic and a bay
leaf, with salt and pepper; dilute with a pint
of good stock, preferably white; strain and
finish by adding the juice of a lemon and an
ounce of fresh butter. By the way, when
fresh pork is to be roasted, it is an excellent
plan to rub salt well into it about twenty-four
hours before cooking. If you slice and serve
it cold you will readily see the wisdom of giving
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>5]</a></span>
the salt a chance to work its way through
and season the whole loin.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Roasted
Ham</div>

<p>When a ham is to be roasted, and small
hams do make excellent roasts, a ham of about
five pounds&rsquo; weight should be skinned and
boiled in enough water to cover it; in this
water you will want to put, just for variety&rsquo;s
sake, a carrot, an onion, three bay-leaves, three
cloves, one clove of garlic, and six peppercorns.
Boil very gently for about one hour;
then remove from the fire, drain it well, and
coat it with a paste of oil and flour. Be sure
that it is well covered with the paste to prevent
the escape of the juice, put into the oven
and roast for about two hours.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Cider Sauce</div>

<p>Serve it with a sauce made of a sufficient
quantity of the stock, to which you have
added half its amount of cider, and there you
behold what is commonly known as champagne
sauce. But, bless you, it&rsquo;s very doubtful
if champagne is often used, as after it is
heated it would be a sensitive palate indeed
that could tell whether champagne or cider
were employed.</p>

<p>Just a hint right here of what may be done
with bits of cold ham, for we may never be
on this subject again. Have some thin slices
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>6]</a></span>
of toasted white bread, spread well with butter
and a trifle of mustard, then equal parts of
grated cheese and minced ham, and some cayenne
pepper. Send to the oven for a few
minutes, or until the cheese is dissolved, and
serve immediately. Say what you will, it is a
delectable dish, this ham toast, and whether
you allow for it in a prearranged luncheon or
whether it is concocted on the impulse of the
moment, when the necessity suddenly arises
for a dish of the kind, trust me, whoever partakes
of it will vow that it &ldquo;relishes of wit
and invention.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="sidenote">Broiled
Pigs&rsquo; Feet</div>

<p>Perhaps this batch of suggestions would be
incomplete with no reference in it to the cooking
of pigs&rsquo; feet, and yet there&rsquo;s very little
variety in the methods of preparing them.
The simplest is the best, it seems to me, and
that is dipping them in melted butter, then in
bread-crumbs, and broiling over a moderate
fire. A piquant sauce is by long odds the
sauce par excellence to be served with them.
Some chefs de cuisine prepare them elaborately
with truffles, to my mind, however,
there&rsquo;s an incongruity in a combination of
pork and truffles. But of course it&rsquo;s only a
matter of taste, and it is more than possible
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>7]</a></span>
that there will be some who read this and deplore
my poor taste in devoting so much space
to ways and means of cooking pork.</p>

<p>Well, to such I offer the suggestion that
they call it a chapter on porcine potentials,
and pass on.</p>

<hr class="break" />

<p>By all means let us be economical&mdash;truly
economical. But let us never make the grievous
but common mistake of thinking that the
buying of cheap, downright cheap food is economy.
To commit such an error in judgment
is to lay the cornerstone of more than one
kind of unhappiness. But you know that, too.
And with so many inexpensive viands as there
are to be had, susceptible as they are of so
many ways of serving, one can, with the exercise
of a little judgment in such matters, have
the appearance of &ldquo;living high&rdquo; when in
reality one is laying up money out of the
weekly table allowance, if one has such an institution
in one&rsquo;s family. For myself, I have
a great respect for a housekeeper who keeps
within her allowance week in and week out,
year after year. But for the one who cuts
loose occasionally from all allowance limits
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>8]</a></span>
when there is a &ldquo;good thing up&rdquo; I have the
sincerest admiration and sympathy. It is
with such a one that I always feel tempted to
outstay my welcome if I get the shadow of a
chance to be so ill bred. Such an ignoring
of trammels of the financial sort is an indication
of truancy in other matters now and
then that rather appeals to me, to be very
honest about it. But I don&rsquo;t recommend it
to you or to any one. Perhaps it hasn&rsquo;t a
place here, but since it is written it shall
stand, labelled <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">En parenth&egrave;se</i>.</p>

<p>And we will talk of codfish&mdash;fresh codfish.
This is a species of the gadus family that is
eligible for duty in a family of any class&mdash;high,
low, or middle. It may follow the soup
at an unlimited course dinner and not be out
of its element or it may form the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pi&egrave;ce de
r&eacute;sistance</i>, or in fact the only piece of any
kind at a dinner of another sort and still be
quite at home.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Fresh

<p>Now let us get to business. Suppose that
some day you have a piping hot oven that is
as idle as you would like to be and that you
have also a fresh codfish in the house split
with the backbone removed for broiling.
Let me suggest that you dry it well, put it in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>9]</a></span>
a buttered baking pan, skin side down, coat it
with melted butter, sprinkle it with salt, pepper,
lemon juice, chopped parsley and chopped
onion. Then bestrew it with bread crumbs
moistened in melted butter and set into the
oven to brown. Get it out as gracefully as
possible when it is done, flip a little melted
butter and lemon juice over it and serve.
Or, if you can&rsquo;t break away from tradition
and have sworn to have a broiled fish broiled
then I am sure that you do keep within your
allowance for the table and will treat the fish
this way: You will dry it well with a cloth,
then brush it with melted butter, sprinkle salt
and a little pepper, put it on the buttered
bars of the broiler, and let the fire do the rest.
Then after it is dished, sprinkle it with perhaps
a few capers, surround it with broiled
thin slices of bacon, and be on the alert to
catch the first expression that flits over the
face of the one who furnishes you with the
aforesaid table allowance to see if all is well
with the fish and consequently with you.
Am I right?</p>

<div class="sidenote">Baked Fresh
Codfish</div>

<p>But I would be willing to wager the price
of a whole &ldquo;catch&rdquo; of codfish that I can tell
you of a bran new way to bake one. Read
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>10]</a></span>
and see for yourself. Have the size that
seems to find most favor in your family and
fill it with a forcemeat made by mincing to
paste a pound of raw codfish. Add to it
half a pint of cream that has been just boiled,
that&rsquo;s all, and thickened with two eggs.
Season with salt, a chopped onion&mdash;chopped
so finely that it is of a paste consistency and
fill the fish with the mixture. For pepper
let me suggest that you use paprika in preference
to any other brand. Cook till the fish
is done and serve with any rich sauce that
appeals to you.</p>

<p>Any or all of the foregoing recipes may be
applied to haddock, as you probably suspect&mdash;if
you know anything at all about fish.</p>

<hr class="break" />

<p>You don&rsquo;t know, you housekeepers of
America what a jolly good reputation you&rsquo;ve
got to live up to unless you happen to have
read G.&nbsp;W. Steevens&rsquo;s clever book, &ldquo;The
Land of the Dollar,&rdquo; in which he says of our
national breakfasts: &ldquo;First you have fruit&mdash;wonderful
pears that look like green stones
and taste like the Tree of Life. Then mush,
so they call oatmeal porridge, or wheatmeal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>11]</a></span>
porridge or hominy porridge, a noble food
with the nectarous American cream. Then
fishes and meats, sausages, and bacon and eggs.
Then strange farinaceous foods which you marvel
to find yourself swallowing with avid gust&mdash;graham
bread, soda biscuits, buckwheat or
griddle cakes with butter and maple treacle.
It is magnificent; but it is indigestion. All
the same, I look forward to the day when
America shall produce an invention that will
let me go across the Atlantic every morning
for breakfast. I shall take a season ticket.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now let my humble pen chip in two or
three things that shall help you to live up to
this estimate of you.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sweet Corn
Croquettes</div>

<p>Suppose you are having a dish of fried
eggs after a manner described later on in this
book. Go still further, and see fit to have
some croquettes also. Do you know just
what they should be? If in doubt let them
be of canned sweet corn. Mix with half a
can of the corn two-thirds of its quantity of
mashed potatoes, salt and a good generous bit
of melted butter. Then form into croquettes,
dip in beaten egg and crumbs and fry to a
fine color in hot fat.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sublimated
Hash</div>

<p>Or, as second choice, you might like hash
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>12]</a></span>
instead of the eggs fried. Now, look here;
you know me well enough by this time, I
hope, to believe that when I suggest hash it is
none of the commonplace minces that you
shun at the table of your very best friend.
Of what I have to say in the line of hash you
won&rsquo;t be overdoing the thing if you refer to
it for evermore as a &ldquo;sublimated hash.&rdquo; See
for yourself: Chop an onion and fry it in a
good bit of butter till it is tender and likewise
brown. Then put into the butter two cupfuls
of diced cold mutton, diced not chopped,
and one cupful of diced cold boiled potatoes.
Pepper and salt to your fancy. Then put in
four tablespoonfuls of tomato sauce and have
ready some chopped parsley for sprinkling
over the dish when it is served.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Rice Muffins</div>

<p>You might for a flyer try rice muffins
with this hash. Have a cup of flour and
sifted through it two heaping teaspoonfuls of
baking powder. Add to it a tablespoonful
of sugar, a saltspoonful of salt, and pass
this through a sieve. Have three eggs well
beaten in a cup of milk with half a cup of
melted butter and stir into the flour. When
it is perfectly smooth add to it two cupfuls of
cold boiled or steamed rice. Turn into
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>13]</a></span>
small pans and bake in a hot oven. By grating
in a little nutmeg to these muffins you
will have a delicious dish for luncheon.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Rhode Island
Johnnycake</div>

<p>Now, our friend Steevens spoke of griddle
cakes and buckwheat cakes. Of these you
know all that is necessary for any housekeeper
to know. But I&rsquo;ll wager a good sum that
Rhode Island meal is an unknown quantity
to you. Make its acquaintance then as soon
as possible and set about having Rhode Island
johnnycakes often. You will want nothing
but the meal, some milk and salt. Have
them considerably thinner than ordinary flour
griddle cakes and fry in a little fat on a hot
griddle so that the edges are crisp and toothsome.
If you want to bake them have a cup
of meal to a cup and one-half of milk with
a pinch of salt, and bake in gem pans till
brown. Instead of having butter with either
the fried or baked specimens of this johnnycake
try some of our &ldquo;nectarous cream.&rdquo; Is
it a go?</p>

<hr class="break" />

<p>Now and then, throughout this book, the
directions for making a salad are brought in
incidentally to the main topic of discourse.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>14]</a></span>
Nowhere are they treated as the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pi&egrave;ce de r&eacute;sistance</i>,
so to speak, of a chapter. And here
are not many&mdash;only a few that go especially
well in cold weather, when to have any variety
at all in salads incurs a considerable outlay of
rumination. Just a little inventive faculty and
a firm purpose to have your table superior,
even in details, to that of your dearest enemy,
and you can with materials on hand in January
have salads that give the eternal chicken and
lobster with mayonnaise the go-by,&mdash;though,
I fear me, the snubbing in the near future
will come from the lobster itself. But that&rsquo;s
not to be discussed at just this minute.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Red Cabbage
Salad</div>

<p>Before this you have probably made red
cabbage salad with a French dressing and
with a spread of mayonnaise over it, so that
you think you know it all, but have you tried
adding to it some celery? This is the way it
is done. All the coarse outside leaves of the
cabbage are removed and the inside is finely
shredded. Then the best stalks of a head of
celery are cut into inch pieces and put into
the salad bowl, a layer of celery, then one of
the cabbage, and so on, heaping a bit in the
centre. Garnish with the fresh green leaves
of the celery; pour a dressing, made of a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>15]</a></span>
beaten egg, three tablespoonfuls of oil, two of
vinegar, a saltspoon of salt, a dash of cayenne,
and a suspicion of mustard, over all,
and let stand for half an hour in a cool place
before serving. For luncheon, when you are
having croquettes of left-over ham bits, or of
cold tongue scraps, this goes very near to
being what would tempt any sane person to
ask for a second helping.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Spanish
Onion Salad</div>

<p>Then there is a way to make an onion salad,
that sets you to wondering why you never
heard of it before. Have the Spanish onions,
and soak them four or five hours, after peeling,
in cold water, changing the water every
hour, or even oftener, if your time isn&rsquo;t too
precious. Then slice and chop them, but
not to the mussy stage. Freeze them, not
too hard, but so they will be crisp and cold.
Meanwhile, prepare a dressing of two-thirds
oil to one-third vinegar, with salt and pepper
to taste, and pour over them. Serve
immediately. But don&rsquo;t forget the garnish,
which naturally suggests itself&mdash;parsley, to
be sure, and plenty of it. With this salad?
Well, we will suppose it is making its d&eacute;but
in your household at an after-theatre snack.
So have with it toasted water crackers, a bit
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>16]</a></span>
of Swiss cheese, a smoked herring or two.
And beer, of course.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sardine
Salad</div>

<p>Now, don&rsquo;t skip what is going down here
about a sardine salad&mdash;you will miss it if you
do. I know you will say you wouldn&rsquo;t fancy
the oil in which they are preserved in a salad,
and I can see that rather superior curl your
lip takes on as you say it. But soak them for
an hour in vinegar, then remove the skin from
them and arrange in a circle on your salad
dish. In the centre heap pitted and quartered
olives. Make a dressing of the strained
juice of a lemon mixed with a tablespoonful
of olive oil, a bit of salt and of paprika, and
over all a sprinkling of capers. Then, take
a taste of it when your turn comes, and be
sorry you were inclined to pass by it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Brussels
Sprouts
Salad</div>

<p>Now and then, you know, we do have a
few Brussels sprouts left over from the day
before&rsquo;s dinner, and at the price usually asked
we couldn&rsquo;t throw them away, and yet there
weren&rsquo;t enough to pay for reheating. So, in
order to be forehanded, and also to have
the &ldquo;makings&rdquo; of a delicious salad in the
house, get double the quantity you usually
have the next time you are getting them, and
be glad for every one that is left over, for the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>17]</a></span>
next day you will sprinkle a few drops of
lemon juice over them, coat them with a
mayonnaise, sprinkle with capers and sliced
olives, and serve very cold. At a simple little
dinner, where you are having &ldquo;left-overs&rdquo;
daintily fixed up, this salad works in beautifully,
or if you are giving a dinner that is as
elaborate as anything you ever turn out, count
on this salad to be one of the features of your
dinner.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Oyster Salad</div>

<p>A delicious offering to put before your
household some night is a salad of oysters.
Have a quart of them, say, drain and wipe
them well from their own liquor. Boil a cup
of vinegar, and season it while boiling with
salt and white pepper. Pour it over the oysters,
and let them stand for two hours or so.
Then drain them pretty dry, and lay on a bed
of chopped celery in the salad bowl. If the
oysters are very large cut in halves or quarters.
Have a layer of chopped celery on top
of the oysters, and coat thickly with mayonnaise.
Be sure, however, that the oysters are
perfectly cold before adding to the celery.
Garnish with a few oyster crabs, pickled at
the same time the oysters were pickled, and
some sliced olives. To be very, very extravagant
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>18]</a></span>
in making this salad, if you so want to
be for the purpose of impressing some one,
add to it a few sliced truffles that have been
soaked in white wine for an hour or two.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Nut Salad</div>

<p>For some occasions, at this season of the
year, a nut salad just fills the bill as nothing
else can. Choose almost any kind of nuts,
but preferably let them be mainly English
walnuts. Have them in halves, or in quarters,
and squeeze lemon juice over them fifteen
minutes before dressing. Then add to them
half their quantity of quartered olives, some
very tender little celery leaves, and a thin
mask of mayonnaise. Really, when you have
turned out this salad, for a party supper, say,
you need give yourselves very little uneasiness
as to how the other viands will set with your
guests. Such a salad is calculated to redeem
a good many faults in other directions.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Fruit Salad</div>

<p>Just a word about a sweet salad, and this
screed is ended. Oranges. It shall be of
oranges&mdash;big, luscious, juicy, seedless oranges,
that are at their height for the next two months
or more. These you slice, after peeling, as
you would an apple. Put a layer of them in
a bowl, sprinkle with powdered sugar and a
few drops of orange cura&ccedil;oa. Then another
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>19]</a></span>
layer of oranges, another of sugar, another
fall of cura&ccedil;oa, and so on till the dish is full.
Then, if there are half a dozen oranges used,
pour over them about half a gill of brandy,
either the plain brandy or apricot brandy.
The latter, I find, is possessed of a mysterious
flavor that, when added to an orange salad,
just sets people to wondering why it is they
have to go away from home to find such
delights.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">O</span>NCE upon a time, one of the resourceless
sort of housekeepers said to me
that she was never quite so stumped
as when she felt the economical burden laid
upon her to utilize lamb or mutton &ldquo;left-overs.&rdquo;
Now, this has been quite the opposite
of my experience. In fact, I wouldn&rsquo;t
acknowledge that I found cold lamb a facer,
anyway.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Roast Lamb
with Caper
Sauce</div>

<p>Suppose we talk of a leg of lamb roasted in
this way: The bone neatly removed, the cavity
filled with a mushroom stuffing, then roasted
in a hot oven and served with caper sauce
and currant jelly. To be sure I know you
would as soon have pledged yourself to break
one of the commandments, as to serve caper
sauce with roasted lamb, if I had not tempted
you. But you will do it, now that the suggestion
has entered your consciousness of gastronomical
beauties.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Roast Lamb
with Onion
Pur&eacute;e</div>

<p>Or, if, in the first blush, it doesn&rsquo;t appeal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>21]</a></span>
to you, there&rsquo;s this way of roasting lamb that
I dare say is new to you. First, make an
onion pur&eacute;e, by mincing one quart of onions
and boiling them till tender. Drain very dry,
put them in a saucepan with two ounces of
butter; season with salt and pepper; let them
simmer for ten or fifteen minutes, but don&rsquo;t
let them brown. Then add to them half a
pint of cream, and press all through a sieve,
when serving as sauce.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Roast Lamb
with
Macaroni</div>

<p>Can you stand another novelty? It&rsquo;s this.
Put the lamb in the roasting-pan, and just a
half hour before you think it is to be done,
take it out and cover the bottom of the pan
with boiled macaroni. Lay the lamb on this,
and prick it all over that the juice may run
over the macaroni. Moisten the macaroni
with a little stock, too, if it threatens to get
too dry or too brown. When the lamb is
roasted take it out, heap the macaroni on a
dish, pour a little tomato sauce over it, sprinkle
with Parmesan and send to table. Have
a little tomato, or any other sauce that pleases
you, with the lamb, if you feel that you must
have a sauce.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Broiled Lamb
Slices</div>

<p>Now, for the second day&mdash;no, the third
day, rather. Skip a day before dishing a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>22]</a></span>
reheating of the lamb. Then get some good
slices from the joint, even as to size and thickness,
and lay them for an hour in a dressing
of two tablespoonfuls of oil, one of Tarragon
vinegar, with salt and pepper. Take them
out of the dressing, dip in bread crumbs, broil
over a hot fire, and serve with a tartar sauce,
or, if you like, with some of the onion pur&eacute;e,
if any was left.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Fried Lamb
with
Chutney</div>

<p>If you like chutney, and of course you do,
have some neat slices of cold lamb spread
with this palate-tickler, roll each slice up, coat
with crumbs, and fry in boiling fat till brown.
Skewer the rolled slices to keep them in shape.
When serving, sprinkle with a few drops of
lemon juice. It will be a question with you,
probably, which of these two ways of reheating
is better. But that&rsquo;s the sort of recipes
with which to load your intelligence, so don&rsquo;t
complain.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Lamb Slices
with Onions
and Mushrooms</div>

<p>Can you digest another warmed-over dish
of lamb? This time have the slices thick
rather than thin, and put them in a stewpan
with enough sherry wine to cover them. Cover
closely, and let heat slowly while you are tossing
together, in a little butter, some minced
boiled onion and button mushrooms. Color
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>23]</a></span>
slightly, and moisten with a little rich stock.
Take up the slices of lamb, arrange in a circle
on a dish, fill the centre with the onions and
mushrooms, pour the wine over all, and take
the trick. It&rsquo;s yours. In case you don&rsquo;t
like as much wine as is required to cover the
lamb, use half wine and half water, and the
juice of a lemon.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Lamb Slices
in Chafing
Dish</div>

<p>If you want to try the reheating of the
lamb in the chafing dish, have it sliced as
neatly as possible, and make ready in the chafing
dish a sauce of one wineglass of port wine,
half a pint of good stock, thickened, a teaspoonful
of walnut ketchup, the same of
French mustard, and a pinch of salt. When
this is hot put in the lamb, and serve as soon
as heated through.</p>

<p>If with any of the foregoing recipes you
think you would fancy a border of rice, have
it, by all means. But have plenty of butter
in the water in which the rice is boiled; or if
it is steamed, have it moistened well with butter
just the same.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Lamb
Croquettes</div>

<p>You might fancy this rice border with lamb
croquettes. These, you know, are made by
having the lamb chopped finely, and added to
it half its quantity of chopped mushrooms.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>24]</a></span>
Moisten with a little tomato sauce, shape and
fry.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Lamb Salad</div>

<p>Surely you will not take offence if I assume,
at this stage of the game, that you are educated
up to a point where you can appreciate
the delights that centre in a lamb salad. You
dice the lamb, having it free of all fat and sinew.
Then put a layer of it in the bottom of the
salad bowl. Have a dressing of oil, vinegar,
pepper, and salt, with a bit of French mustard
in it, at hand, and with this sprinkle the
lamb. Bestrew it, too, with a chopped anchovy
or two, or more, if you are fond of anchovies.
Then put in a layer of cold boiled potatoes,
diced&mdash;more dressing; another stratum of
lamb, and so on till the dish is full, having it
mound-shaped. Garnish with sliced gherkins
and capers, and let it go at that.</p>

<hr class="break" />

<p>I would that fewer nursery rhymers had
taken trips to market for their text when their
pens took to turning out jingles; for goodness
knows that what with &ldquo;To market, to
market to buy a fat pig,&rdquo; and &ldquo;To market,
to market, all on a market day,&rdquo; keeping up
a continuous jig-like theme in my mind, to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>25]</a></span>
say nothing of the insistent interruptions by
the &ldquo;little pig that went to market&rdquo; I am
well-nigh distracted when I try to get dry-as-dust
facts from the marketman anent commonplace
eatables. To be sure, if I go in search
of frogs&rsquo; legs, say, and the story of the frog
who went a-wooing recurs to my mind three
or four times in a minute, it seems quite appropriate
and doesn&rsquo;t interfere in the least
with my driving a pretty sharp bargain with
the fish-dealer. But, so far as I know, no
poet or writer of assonance has taken it into
his head to sing a song of livers, kidneys, and
such like edibles of which I am telling you
herein, and no wonder, you may say, if I don&rsquo;t
succeed in making my story fairly interesting,
as well as appetizing&mdash;though from the nature
of it if it is one it must be the other.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Kidneys <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en
Brochette</span></div>

<p>Everybody knows, I fancy, that when one
has cut off the skin of some lambs&rsquo; kidneys,
and then cut the kidneys into quarter-inch-thick
slices, seasoned them with salt and pepper,
dipped them in oil, and then threaded
them on skewers with alternating slices of
bacon a brochette of kidneys is well under
way. To complete the operation they are
dipped into oil, then into bread-crumbs and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>26]</a></span>
broiled over a slow fire. In serving there&rsquo;s
no reason in the world why one should not
indulge one&rsquo;s fancy for any simple sauce that
will help the kidneys to tickle one&rsquo;s palate.
Good as this dish is, I must confess I like
it better when chickens&rsquo; livers are substituted
for the kidneys. By the way, do you
know that every up-to-date marketman has
them all skewered, and all that you have to
do is to add the seasoning and see to the
broiling?</p>

<div class="sidenote">Fried
Kidneys with
Mushrooms</div>

<p>Another really delightful way of serving
lambs&rsquo; kidneys is to prepare in a frying-pan a
tablespoonful of chopped onions, a small
chopped shallot, a clove of garlic and as many
fresh mushrooms as you feel like buying, with
salt and pepper to taste, and an ounce or so
of butter; don&rsquo;t let the vegetables color at all,
and perhaps the best way to avoid this is to
add a gill or so of any kind of wine and the
same of cream. Let this sauce mull a while
on the back of the range, while you broil the
number of kidneys desired, after having
skinned and split each one in two lengthwise.
Dish and pour over them the sauce, removing
from it the garlic. If you&rsquo;ve never heard
of this way for preparing kidneys, it seems
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>27]</a></span>
to me that you should be very grateful to me
for calling your attention to it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Minced
Kidneys<br />
<br />
Macaroni
Croquettes</div>

<p>And may your gratitude be re-enforced
after you have tried cooking veal kidneys in
this fashion: Mince three very small ones,
after removing all the fat and fibrous parts,
and fry them in butter over a hot fire. Don&rsquo;t
let them get wizzled up, but just done to a
turn, then take from the frying-pan and add
to the butter in which they were fried some
tomato sauce highly seasoned, half a can of
mushrooms, some lemon juice, and chopped
parsley; pour over the kidneys and even if
you serve them in just this manner they will
prove a great success; but should you wish to
make it a dish to linger in one&rsquo;s memory, then
garnish it with macaroni croquettes. Ever
make them? Well, boil a pound of macaroni
in salted water for fifteen minutes. Then drain
and cut it into quarter-inch lengths; put back
into the saucepan with a little grated cheese, a
little salt, cayenne pepper and a gill of cream.
Let it get perfectly cold, then mould into
croquettes, either cylinder-shaped or any other
form, only have them very small; dip in egg
and bread-crumbs and fry a pretty brown.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>28]</a></span>
These macaroni croquettes, by the way,
make a suitable garnish for any number of
dishes; try them with veal cutlets some time,
or with thin, dainty slices of ham broiled for
luncheon, and you&rsquo;ll get more than your
labor for your pains.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Fried Calf&rsquo;s
Liver</div>

<p>If you are thinking to have liver, then my
advice to you is to get if possible only that
of a calf. To buy that of an older &ldquo;beef
critter&rdquo; is so often a waste of time and
money that it&rsquo;s just as well to forego buying
it altogether&mdash;it is so apt to have too much
flavor, so to speak, or be tough or stringy,
and wholly unsatisfactory. But get a calf&rsquo;s
liver, and something of a treat is in store for
you, whether you fry it with bacon or prepare
it in this way: Cut up finely three or
four good-sized white onions and fry them in
butter till of a golden brown. Drain the
butter off and cover the onions with white
stock; let cook for half an hour, then moisten
with more stock and season with pepper, salt,
chopped parsley, and just a suspicion of lemon
juice. Fry the slices of liver, which should
not be over half an inch in thickness, in
enough butter to keep them from hardening;
drain off the butter and add the above
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>29]</a></span>
sauce; let it boil up once, then serve, and
garnish with slices of lemon. Perhaps this is
a bit heavy for a breakfast dish&mdash;to my
mind it is decidedly so&mdash;while for luncheon,
where one is having a salad of watercress, or
for an entr&eacute;e at dinner it seems to be quite
in its rightful place.</p>

<p>If the liver is to be served for breakfast,
then it is a good idea to roll the slices in a
little flour, sprinkle melted butter over them
and broil over the coals, squeezing just enough
lemon juice and sprinkling just enough
chopped parsley over them to make them
grateful to the taste and eye when served.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sauce for
Calf&rsquo;s Liver</div>

<p>But why don&rsquo;t you try to invent a sauce
for calf&rsquo;s liver? Fry it in plenty of butter,
then add to the butter, when the liver is removed,
anything that your palate suggests or
which your common sense approves. For
instance, put in a few tiny slices of gherkin,
a handful of mushrooms, a soup&ccedil;on of tomato
sauce, a few capers, a little lemon juice,
chopped chives or chervil, chopped shallot or
any herb or condiment that you may have in
the house. Of course you don&rsquo;t want to use
all of these articles, but try a combination of
any two or three or more of them, with the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>30]</a></span>
addition of a little stock and&mdash;who knows?&mdash;you
may invent a sauce that will make you
as famous as was B&eacute;chamel, Cond&eacute; or Car&ecirc;me.
Success be with you!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do be kind enough some of these times
when you are scribbling about the good things
at market to bear in mind that not every one
is hale and hearty and blessed with digestive
organs that could stand a diet of shingle nails.
Give a thought to the poor unfortunates that
are obliged to think twice before gratifying
their appetites once.&rdquo; Thus wailed one of the
said &ldquo;poor unfortunates&rdquo; once upon a time,
and as a result of the complaint I have since
been &ldquo;holding them in thought&rdquo; to a considerable
extent, with a view to making the material
aspect of a period of invalidism and
convalescence a bit the brighter.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Chicken
Broth with
Oatmeal</div>

<p>Of course we all know that the list of eatables
allowed an invalid or a convalescent is of
necessity a rather short one; but there is an
infinite number of ways for varying the list,
if one will use a little judgment and good
taste in preparing the dishes. We have all
had experience in seeing a sick person make
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>31]</a></span>
a wry face at the mention of gruel or porridge,
and precious little we blamed him for
it, to tell the truth. But the whole condition
of affairs may be changed by preparing
it in this way: Have a pint of good clear
chicken broth, free from fat and not too
strong; boil it, and into it shake slowly a cup
of oatmeal or wheaten grits; let it cook for
half an hour or so, pass it through a wire sieve,
and add to it a little more broth if that is
necessary to make it fit to be sipped easily
from a cup without using a spoon. Take it
to the sick-room with the remark, &ldquo;I have
brought you a little pur&eacute;e of oatmeal,&rdquo; and
my word for it you will not see a drop left in
the cup.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Pur&eacute;e of
Barley</div>

<p>And a pur&eacute;e of barley will be quite as
acceptable. Soak the barley over night, and
the next morning cover it with chicken broth;
boil until the barley bursts, adding broth from
time to time as it cooks away; when the broth
begins to thicken, which will be at the end of
about three hours&rsquo; time, strain it through a
very fine sieve. Serve it in a cup; and if you
dare do such a thing, add a tiny bit of butter
to it. It makes it a deal more palatable, and
I don&rsquo;t believe it will harm the patient; but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>32]</a></span>
it&rsquo;s quite possible the physician in charge
may think otherwise.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Beef Tea</div>

<p>There are ways and ways for making beef
tea; but the best of all ways, it seems to me,
is to have round steak about one inch in
thickness, broil it for two minutes on each side
over a brisk fire, cut it up into inch squares,
cover it with cold water, and let it steep, not
boil, for two hours. Serve it in a cup, and
salt when serving. You and the ailing one
will find, I think, that the broiling of the
steak gives the tea a flavor that makes it &ldquo;hit
the spot&rdquo;&mdash;a consummation devoutly to be
wished when one is catering for an invalid.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Cream Soup</div>

<p>Cream soups make a pleasing change after
plain broths or teas. Take any white stock
that is rich, free from fat and well seasoned.
Put into a saucepan half a pint of the stock
and the same quantity of cream. When it
comes to a boil add one tablespoonful of flour
thoroughly moistened with cold milk, and let
it boil at once. Serve with it finger-pieces of
thin buttered toast.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sabayon of
Chicken</div>

<p>A highly nutritious dish is made by putting
four egg-yolks into a double boiler, diluting
them with half a pint of clear chicken broth,
and beating the mixture with a whip or beater
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>33]</a></span>
until it becomes thick and frothy. When it
is done add two teaspoonfuls of sherry to it,
and serve in a cup; have it just as hot as possible.
And if the person for whom you concoct
this appetizing affair insists upon knowing
its name, you may say that it is a sabayon of
chicken.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Chicken
Custard</div>

<p>And, by the way, what an endless amount
of dainty edibles may be made from chicken!
Take a chicken custard, for instance; could
anything be daintier? Have a cupful of good
clear chicken stock, and add to it an equal
quantity of cream; cook it for a few minutes,
then put it into a double boiler, and add the
beaten yolks of three eggs and a little salt.
Cook until the mixture thickens a little, and
then pour it into custard cups to be served
cold. It&rsquo;s an ungrateful, whimsical, and
grumpy sort of an invalid who doesn&rsquo;t reckon
as a red-letter day the time when he first
tasted of a chicken custard. But whether or
not this is the case, you will have to keep
right on shaking up your ideas and producing
other dishes.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Tapioca Jelly</div>

<p>In all probability you will try your hand
at jelly-making; and when you have exhausted
your own stock of recipes try making
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>34]</a></span>
a tapioca jelly. To prepare it, soak one cup
of tapioca in three cups of water over night.
In the morning put it into a double boiler
with a cup of hot water, and let it simmer
until perfectly clear, stirring often. Sweeten
to taste and flavor with the juice of half a
lemon and two tablespoonfuls of wine. Pour
into cups, and set away to get perfectly cold.
When serving, sprinkle with powdered sugar
and heap a little whipped cream on it.</p>

<p>Or it may be that a blanc-mange made
with tapioca will seem to you worth the trying.
If so, soak a cupful of tapioca in two
cups of water over night. In the morning
put it into the double boiler, and stir into it
two cups of boiling milk, three tablespoonfuls
of sugar, and a pinch of salt. Cook it slowly
for fifteen minutes, stirring several times.
Take it from the fire, and flavor with wine
or vanilla. Let it harden in small moulds,
and serve with powdered sugar and whipped
cream.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Violet Jelly</div>

<p>And some day when the patient is unusually
capricious try surprising him or her with a
violet jelly. A woman I know told me not
long ago that she had found it more efficacious
than a dozen &ldquo;soft answers.&rdquo; Have a pint
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>35]</a></span>
of clear boiling syrup, and into it throw a
heaping handful of fresh violets, after removing
the stalks; let this simmer, tightly covered,
for half an hour. Then strain the liquor,
and add to it half an ounce of gelatine dissolved
in a very little water, the juice of an
orange, and two teaspoonfuls of violet vegetable
coloring, which is as harmless as so much
cold water. Turn it into a mould, and set on
ice to harden.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Steamed
Rice</div>

<p>When boiled or steamed rice is ordered, try
preparing it in this way. Wash a cupful of
it thoroughly and put into the double boiler
with just enough water to cover it. When
the rice is nearly done, pour off the water, if
any remains, and add one cup of milk and a
little salt. Let the rice cook thoroughly till
done. Beat an egg well, and the last thing
before taking the rice from the fire stir the
egg in as lightly as possible, and serve hot
with sugar and cream. The egg makes the
dish a bit more attractive and considerably
more nutritious.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Invalid&rsquo;s
Chop</div>

<p>I wonder if you have ever tried cooking a
lamb chop or cutlet in this way. Have three
cutlets cut, two of them rather thinner than
the third, then tie them together, the thick
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>36]</a></span>
one in the middle. Broil over a hot fire till
the outside cutlets are burnt to a crisp, and at
that stage you will find the inside one in just
the right condition for serving; salt it, and
serve piping hot. With it serve a baked
potato that has been pressed through a sieve.
Sprinkle the potato with salt and moisten it
with a little cream. To be sure you may
think that a somewhat expensive way of cooking
a lamb chop, and so it is from some points
of view; but it will set any self-respecting
convalescent at least two days ahead on his
journey to complete recovery, and when you
think of it in that way you see it&rsquo;s positively
cheap. All these things, yea, and a thousand
more, must be taken into consideration when
one is in attendance upon a sick person.</p>

<hr class="break" />

<p>To say that every one should have a chafing-dish
in these days were to be trite&mdash;everyone
should have seven chafing-dishes, or as
near that number as possible; not one for
every day in the week exactly, but rather
that, if you are having a little after-the-opera
or after-the-theatre jollification and have a
dozen or so hungry ones to feed, there may
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>37]</a></span>
be enough to go round, and also that you
may have a variety of dainties.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Creamed
Oysters</div>

<p>Not all will want creamed oysters, of
course, but you can set a pretty girl to preparing
this dish for those who do want it.
Give her about half a pint of rich, thick
cream, an ounce or so of butter and a teaspoonful
of flour which she will braid together
in the most approved cooking-school fashion
for thickening the cream when it is hot.
Then she should put in two dozen or so oysters
that have been well drained and freed from
any bits of shell. If you can trust her to do
so, let her season the dish with a dash of red
pepper, and salt, and a shake or two of celery
salt. When the edges of the oysters begin to
frizzle, have ready for her either little strips of
toast or some crackers on hot plates, on which
to serve the oysters. If you find that more
than three persons will be apt to bid for the
creamed oysters, you will want rather more
than two dozen, I fancy; still, you will know
best about that.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Flaked Cold
Cod in
Tomato</div>

<p>If you have any cold fish in the house, halibut
or cod or haddock that has been boiled or
baked, not fried, have it flaked up in good-sized
pieces and marinated for three or four
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>38]</a></span>
hours in a tablespoonful each of oil and vinegar,
a dash of cayenne, the juice of an onion
and salt to taste. When you are to use it
have hot in the chafing-dish three teaspoonfuls
each of rich tomato sauce, sherry wine
and butter, putting the butter in and melting
it first. When these are well blended together,
lay in the fish and stir it about in the
sauce till quite hot. This, let me tell you,
will not go a-begging for admirers. It is a
particularly savory tidbit, and on a cold night
is its own best recommendation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Lobster
Newberg</div>

<p>I wonder if you will say a recipe for lobster
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">&agrave; la</i> Newberg is altogether too stale if I undertake
to tell it to you. I know its age just as
well as you do, and I also know that I could
weep bitterly, if it would do any good, at some
of the concoctions called by that name that I
have had put before me, and which, worse
than all, I have been expected to eat. So
right here I shall put on record my way of
preparing that delicious dish, and if you don&rsquo;t
care to read it, why skip it, of course. Into
the chafing dish put two ounces of butter and
let it melt; then put in the meat of a two-pound
lobster cut into dice-shaped pieces and
let them cook till they are really fried a bit.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>39]</a></span>
Then turn low the flame of the lamp while
you pour in a little less than a pint of cream
in which has been beaten three eggs, seasoned
with salt and red pepper. Just as this is hot
add a scant wineglass of sherry and let it
heat once more, regulating the flame all the
time so that it cannot boil. For if it does
the jig is up, the eggs will be sure to curdle,
and you will wish to goodness you hadn&rsquo;t
undertaken it. Have little triangles of
toasted bread on which to serve the lobster,
and if it turns out the success it should, your
reputation among your guests will be for all
time established as a hostess who knows her
business from A to Z.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Chicken
Livers with
Olive Sauce</div>

<p>If you will get some chicken livers you can
prepare a very appetizing dish with very little
trouble. Melt an ounce of butter in the
chafing dish and in it put, say, eight or ten
livers that have been salted well and rolled
in a little flour. Let them cook pretty fast
for ten minutes, or till you think they are
done, then put with them half a pint of hot
water and a teaspoonful of any extract of beef,
with what salt and pepper your superior judgment
deems suitable. When this is hot turn
in a gill of sherry, and a dozen olives pitted and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>40]</a></span>
quartered. Just a dash of lemon juice and
the deed is done, provided you have ready
some toast for the serving of the livers.</p>

<p>If you haven&rsquo;t at the time of night when
you will be serving these dishes a fire over
which you can toast the bread, you can have
one of the guests preparing the bread in a
chafing dish. Cut the slices of the size you
like and fry them delicately in a very little
butter and they will go finely in this way.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Welsh
Rabbit</div>

<p>Because you may think I don&rsquo;t know how
to make one if I say nothing, I suppose I
shall have to offer a word or so about Welsh
rabbits. Melt an ounce of butter in the
chafing-dish and then stir in and let melt
slowly a pound of cheese cut up into very
small pieces. Season this as you go along
with paprika, a little salt, and mustard as you
think you like it. When the cheese is quite
melted pour in, very slowly, a little beer or
ale, about two gills in all. Then when it is
well blended with the cheese stir in a couple
of eggs well beaten and serve on crackers.
Did you ever try making your rabbits with
ginger ale? Really they are good in that
way, and it is very palatable to drink when
you are eating them. And cider is delicious
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>41]</a></span>
served with rabbits, also&mdash;the champagne
cider. Try it some time.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Golden Buck</div>

<p>For a golden buck, prepare the cheese as
for a rabbit, but on each plate when you are
serving it place a poached egg. These must
be prepared in another dish while the rabbit
is under process of construction. So, you
see, I wasn&rsquo;t so far off in my calculations,
rapid as they seemed to you at the time, when
I said my little say about seven chafing dishes.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Eggs
Poached in
Tomato</div>

<p>Suppose you have on hand a pint of rich
tomato sauce. Heat this in the chafing-dish
and poach in it two eggs. Lift them out and
lay on a hot dish while you poach two more.
Continue in this way till you have half-a-dozen
eggs poached. Serve one or two as you like,
on a slice of toast or fried bread, pour some
of the tomato sauce round, sprinkle grated
Parmesan cheese over each and send them
around the table on their mission.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Curried Eggs</div>

<p>If you are fond of curry try some curried
eggs. Melt in the chafing-dish two ounces
of butter, and fry in it two small onions,
sliced; take these out and stir in a dessertspoonful
of curry powder and a teaspoonful
of Worcestershire sauce. When these are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>42]</a></span>
well mixed add half a dozen well-beaten eggs.
Cook quickly and serve.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Creamed
Chicken</div>

<p>Perhaps you have a pet recipe for creamed
chicken, and I don&rsquo;t doubt it is all such a recipe
should be; but let me suggest that, instead
of putting chicken and cream and all
the other things into the chafing-dish at the
same time, you melt the butter first and then
stir in the chicken and let it cook for two or
three minutes before you put in the cream, or
b&eacute;chamel, or whatever it is you use. The
flavor of the dish will be very much richer
and more palatable to most persons. For, between
ourselves, I think that creamed chicken
is apt to be rather a flat and tasteless affair,
and will stand quite a little bracing up.</p>

<p>I hope you won&rsquo;t want to spoil the taste of
any of these dishes by having sweets after
them, in the way of fancy cakes, etc. If you
do, you may choose them for yourselves.
I&rsquo;ll have none of them.</p>

pray don&rsquo;t be alarmed; I&rsquo;ve no notion of
passing round any of the popular brands of
cigars. Neither would I so much as offer you
cigarettes, albeit the latest scientific utterance
has pronounced them harmless.</p>

<p>No, our talk shall be of some of the smoked
and salted viands that, while they may not
perhaps come under the head of delicacies or
indelicacies of the season, are decidedly appetizing,
and quite worthy of having considerable
attention given to the best ways and means

<div class="sidenote">Salt Fish
with Cream</div>

<p>And haven&rsquo;t you been saddened hundreds
of times when reflecting upon the disregard
of details that makes of a dish of salt-fish and
cream nothing but a pasty and altogether horrid
mess? But a dish of salted cod becomes
delicacy itself if the fish is shredded while raw,
all skin and bone removed, washed several
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>44]</a></span>
times in cold water and cooked in plenty of
fresh water; then it should be drained and
covered with cream, which has been heated
and thickened with an egg or two beaten up
well in a tablespoonful or so of cream; add
a dash of cayenne, to give it a zest, and you
have prepared for breakfast or luncheon a
dainty that will quite justify you in fancying
yourself for the rest of the day. And that&rsquo;s
a wonderfully comfortable state of mind in
which to find oneself.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Salt Fish
with Brown
Butter</div>

<p>Perhaps, however, for a luncheon dish you
would rather have the codfish served with
brown butter. In which case you flake and
freshen it as before, and cook in plenty of
water. Take it up on a hot dish and pour
over it a sauce made of butter, in which you
have fried minced onion and a handful of
chopped parsley till they are brown. And you
can vary this sauce infinitely: add a bay leaf
or two, or a few capers, or some chopped sweet
red peppers, and get a new flavor with each
addition.</p>

<p>The subject of codfish balls I won&rsquo;t take
up here. I fear I might make it too exhaustive.
And, besides, every housekeeper seems
to have a chosen way for preparing them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Fried Cods&rsquo;
Tongues</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>45]</a></span>
I wish as much could be said about that
too-little-appreciated genuine delicacy&mdash;fresh
cods&rsquo; tongues. They are delicious when boiled
till tender, and then served with brown butter,
as suggested above for codfish. And they
are just as good, and some think even better,
if they are dipped in milk, then rolled one by
one in flour, and fried in plenty of butter for
about ten minutes. You can simply pour
the butter on them when serving, with a little
chopped parsley scattered over all, or you can
put into the frying-pan, after taking the tongues
out, a gill or two of tomato sauce, and serve
this separately in a sauceboat, serving each
tongue on a slice of toast. Usually it will be
found necessary to soak the salted tongues for
twenty-four hours or more in water, changing
it once or twice, as seems necessary.</p>

<p>To be sure there&rsquo;s considerable trouble and
no small amount of care involved in having
these edibles, or any others, for that matter,
quite as one would like, but some old wiseacre
has said that life&rsquo;s cares are its comforts,
and if one only has a firm belief, rooted and
grounded in past experience, in this bit of
philosophy it&rsquo;s just as easy to apply it to cooking
as to painting.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Broiled
Smoked
Salmon</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>46]</a></span>
And a little of this care used in the broiling
of smoked salmon redeems it from the
charred and uninviting dish it too often makes.
It is best to cut the salmon into small strips,
wrap each strip in a piece of buttered paper,
and then broil over a clear fire. When done
remove the paper, and serve the fish on a
piping hot dish, at once. And if you want
a sauce for it make one by cooking a minced
onion in a gill of vinegar and twice as much
water, adding, as the onion shows signs of
tenderness, two ounces of fresh butter, four
finely chopped hard-boiled egg yolks, and a
little chopped parsley.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Boiled Salt
Mackerel,
with Horse-radish
Sauce</div>

<p>Of course you know how to cook salt mackerel&mdash;you
could sue me for libel if I said
aught to the contrary. But do you, I wonder,
ever try preparing it in my favorite way?
This is the manner of it: Soak the mackerel
for twelve hours, changing the water several
times. Then boil it in an abundance of water,
in which there is a bay leaf, two or three
onions, some parsley and the juice of a lemon.
The fish should cook very slowly, and not be
allowed to come to pieces. When they are
done, serve them on a folded napkin, with a
sauce made by reducing a pint of cream to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>47]</a></span>
one-half, adding to it an ounce of butter, and
thickening it with two egg yolks. Then add
to it half its quantity of grated horse-radish,
heating it again, without boiling. In most
cases it is necessary to add salt to this sauce,
but I prescribe no quantity. I only advise
being skittish about the amount when it is to
be used for a salt fish. If you are to have
smoked mackerel, broil instead of boiling it
and serve with it the cream horse-radish sauce.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Smoked
Herring
Fried</div>

<p>And then there are smoked and salted herring,
that if cooked judiciously make life at
least a bit more comfortable. It is best to
soak them for five or six hours in water and
then for two hours in sweet, fresh milk, after
which you can work out some wonderful dishes
with them. If they have been salted only,
fry in butter and serve them on potatoes
mashed with cream. But if the herring are
smoked as well as salted, split them down the
back and cook in enough milk to cover.
Cook till thoroughly done, and then serve on
a very hot dish with branches of parsley
around, and a little sweet rich cream poured
over them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Finnan
Haddies with
Cream</div>

<p>But, to my thinking, the best of all the
smoked and salted fish are the finnan haddies.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>48]</a></span>
And one of the best ways of cooking them is
as per that last described for cooking herring.
But the haddies are much less salt, and require
little, if any, soaking. Or, if you prefer, you
can put them in a buttered baking-pan, pour
cream and bread crumbs over them and brown
in a hot oven. Give them a little more
cream when serving. And again after you
and your household have partaken of this dish
and pronounced it good, hard to beat, etc., you
will have occasion to be pleased with yourself,
which, being interpreted, means of course being
perfectly satisfied with all the world.</p>

<hr class="break" />

<p>It is possible, nay, probable, that you,
mesdames, with all the calls that the Lenten
season makes upon your spiritual selves, find
little time for ordering or arranging dinners;
furthermore&mdash;and it&rsquo;s in no way to your discredit&mdash;it
may be that with so much of each
day given over to reflection and concentrated
thought you experience a sort of disinclination
to give heed to things material. Therefore it
behooves me to be alive to my duty, which
in the premises certainly seems to prescribe
that I shall think and plan a bit for you; and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>49]</a></span>
I herewith submit, as the result of a goodly
amount of cogitation on my part, a menu
which I hope will strike you as being a very
good sort of &ldquo;working model,&rdquo; should you
not care to follow it to the letter:&mdash;</p>

<p class="menu">
Consomm&eacute; maigre with asparagus points.<br />
Lake trout with court bouillon.<br />
Macaroni timbales with tomato sauce.<br />
Casserole of fillets of sole.<br />
Oyster souffl&eacute;s.<br />
Coffee cream glac&eacute;e.<span class="mspace1">&nbsp;</span>Almond pudding.
</p>

<p>You see that such a menu provides a dinner
perfectly within the rule implied by &ldquo;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">diner
maigre</i>,&rdquo; though it can in no sense be called
a fast-day dinner. In fact, the very phrase is
a contradiction. If you are fasting, you do
not dine; you simply eat to live&mdash;a very
different thing.</p>

<p>And now for particulars. No need to tell
you how to make the soup; you have stacks
of cookery books that will give you the information
necessary for the making of a good
clear consomm&eacute;. As for the asparagus points,
it will be quite as well from all points of view
to buy the canned asparagus tips, and cook
a little in salted water, adding them to the
soup about five minutes before it is served.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Boiled Lake
Trout</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>50]</a></span>
Perhaps your housekeepers&rsquo; guides may not
be sufficiently explicit in regard to cooking
the lake trout in the manner suggested, so I
will tell you in detail. In the first place, you
take equal quantities of white French wine&mdash;as
inexpensive as you please&mdash;and water, one
small onion, a bouquet of parsley, thyme, etc.,
some peppercorns, and a proper amount of
salt. Let this boil for fifteen minutes, and
you have as good a court bouillon as one
could wish. Into it put the trout, tied into
any shape you desire, and boil until tender;
remove it, and serve on a fish paper or napkin;
garnish with fresh green parsley sprays.
For the sauce, you will melt some butter in a
part of the court bouillon, and serve separately.
You should find good lake trout in
the market now, and at a price that doesn&rsquo;t
confine them to the list of luxuries. Aren&rsquo;t
you glad?</p>

<div class="sidenote">Macaroni
Timbales</div>

<p>Have you any idea how many ways are
known to expert cooks for preparing macaroni?
I haven&rsquo;t. But I should not be
surprised to see offered for sale any day
a publication setting forth &ldquo;One Thousand
Ways to Cook Macaroni,&rdquo; and I hope that
macaroni timbales, in case such an event
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>51]</a></span>
comes to pass, will be given the place of
honor. Try making them in this way, and
you will agree with me. Boil the macaroni in
plenty of salted water till it is tender, but not
&ldquo;mushy.&rdquo; Drain off the water, and add,
with all thoughts of economy thrown to the
winds, melted butter; stir it in well, and add a
goodly sprinkling of grated Parmesan cheese
and cayenne pepper. Line a mould with the
very best puff-paste you know how to make,
rolled as thinly as possible, and put in the
macaroni; cover with a round of the paste,
lay a sheet of buttered paper over the top, and
bake in a hot oven for about thirty minutes.
Unmould on a hot dish, and pour round it
some tomato sauce made from the best recipe
given in any of your gastronomical literature.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Casserole of
Fillets of
Sole</div>

<p>Then consult the aforesaid literature still
further, and select therefrom the most appetizing
recipe for making a stuffing of bread-crumbs,
when you have it properly prepared
spread with it some fillets of sole, and tie
them into shape with a little thread. Now
put into a casserole, or stewpan, three or four
ounces of butter, two minced onions, and the
fish; let it fry for five or six minutes, then
add to it two or three gills of b&eacute;chamel sauce
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>52]</a></span>
(see cookery books once more), a cupful of
chopped mushrooms, and a claret-glass of
claret. Cover the pan closely, and cook in
the oven for half an hour. When finished,
remove the strings from the fillets, and serve
in a deep dish with the liquor in which they
were cooked poured over them. And there
you have a dish fit to tickle the palate of any
king, or knave, that ever lived. Later in the
season, when lobsters are selling at a more
reasonable price, try substituting them for
the soles, and your delight will be increased
several-fold.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Oyster
Souffl&eacute;s</div>

<p>Very likely you know as much or more
than I do about making oyster souffl&eacute;s, but,
be that as it may, I have the floor, and am
going to tell you what I do know about them,
for I may never get another chance. My
way is to blanch two dozen good oysters in
their own liquor, then cut them into dice,
and while they are cooling prepare a sauce of
two ounces each of butter and flour, a dust
of cayenne, a little salt, the yolks of three
eggs, and half a pint of rich milk; when
it is thick enough and smooth enough I put
in the oysters and their liquor, pour the mixture
into little souffl&eacute; cases, sprinkle each with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>53]</a></span>
browned bread-crumbs and bits of butter,
and bake in a moderate oven for eighteen
minutes; then serve at once. How do you
think you would like to try that way of making
them?</p>

<div class="sidenote">Coffee
Cream
Glac&eacute;e</div>

<p>Now, you will admit that I very seldom
presume to tell you how to prepare sweets,
but to-day my story would be incomplete
if I were to omit the directions for making a
coffee cream glac&eacute;e. It is easy as can be;
that is, if you can freeze things. Beat the
yolks of four eggs in a basin with four ounces
of powdered sugar, standing the basin in another
of hot water, so that they may get quite
warm, but not hot; add to them a gill of
strong coffee, beat it all together till it is
light and creamy and quite cold. Then add
to it a pint of stiffly whipped cream, pour the
mixture into a mould, and bury in ice and salt
for two hours. Unmould on the prettiest
piece of lace paper you have when serving.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Almond
Pudding</div>

<p>Perhaps I run the risk of overdoing the
matter by telling you how to make an almond
pudding, but it does harmonize so delightfully
with coffee glac&eacute;e that &rsquo;twould be actually
sinful to leave you in ignorance of how it
is made. It&rsquo;s simple, too, simple as a&nbsp;b&nbsp;c.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>54]</a></span>
You just beat up the yolks of five and the
whites of three eggs with a large tablespoonful
of rose-water, and add gradually to it four
ounces of powdered sugar and four ounces of
freshly ground almonds, mixed with a few
small whole ones. Beat this thoroughly for
ten or fifteen minutes, pour into a well-buttered
pie-dish and bake. When half-cooked,
garnish with strips of candied orange peel
and blanched almonds. And if you have
any of the pudding left, which is doubtful,
you will find that it makes an excellent five-o&rsquo;clock
tea cake, for it is quite as good cold
as hot.</p>

<p>Now, have I not given you a good ground
plan, so to speak, for Lenten dinners? It is
the easiest thing in the world to leave out a
part of it, or add to it, for that matter, for it
is composed wholly of neutral tints, you might
say, and almost any viand under the sun will
dovetail with it, if you wish to elaborate it.</p>

<hr class="break" />

<p>I really don&rsquo;t know the first thing about
the dietetic properties of eggs, for which
ignorance I am truly grateful, because I have
always noticed that once a man or a woman
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>55]</a></span>
gets where the healthfulness or the hurtfulness
of any edible becomes the first consideration
all real pleasure to be found in dining
has for that man or woman lost half its
charm.</p>

<p>Neither could I guess, though I had a
dozen chances, whether the fact that eggs
form the backbone of so many meals during
Lent has its foundation in history, or some
religious rite. And I am also content to
remain uninformed on this point.</p>

<p>But I do know that at market these days
the sign &ldquo;strictly fresh eggs&rdquo; is the most
noticeable feature on every hand; and I
know, too, that there are a good many housekeepers
who fairly long to know of some way
in which to improve upon the neutral flavor of
an egg so that it may become dainty, savory or
delicately sweet as the case may seem to require.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Eggs Curdled
in Cream</div>

<p>To begin with the savory list: Some fine
morning when you are to have for breakfast
just an appetizing bit of broiled salted
herring, try cooking some eggs in this way&mdash;Put
half a pint of cream into a saucepan and
let it boil. Stir into it five well-beaten eggs,
seasoned with salt and pepper. Let this
mixture curdle, then turn it out on to a hot
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>56]</a></span>
dish and brown it quickly with a salamander;
and you&rsquo;ll be at a loss to know whether it&rsquo;s
the herring that makes the egg taste so well,
or if it&rsquo;s the egg that makes the herring so
remarkably palatable.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Eggs, Epicurean
Style</div>

<p>Another delicious way of serving eggs for
breakfast is to have, as a beginning, say one
dozen eggs and boil them till hard; take off
their shells, cut them in halves and rub the
yolks through a fine sieve; put an ounce of
butter and one cupful of cream into a saucepan,
season it with salt and white pepper and
thicken with a very little flour. When it is
quite hot but not boiling stir into it half of
the whites of the eggs, chopped, and the yolks.
Arrange the remainder of the whites on a dish,
pour the mixture over them, and serve piping
hot. You see the eggs can be boiled and prepared
the day before, and there&rsquo;s very little
to be done to get them ready for breakfast.
Now, should you want to make this into a
more savory dish, you could easily add a little
minced ham, the juice of an onion, or some
minced olives and a few mushrooms, and have
by so doing a delectable luncheon dish that
would go admirably with, say, some cold sliced
tongue or with pickled lambs&rsquo; tongues.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Baked Eggs</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>57]</a></span>
A particularly savory dish of eggs is made
by frying two small minced onions in butter
till they are brown; then mix with them a
dessertspoonful of vinegar, a very little salt,
and some pepper. Butter a dish, spread the
onions over it, break over them half a dozen
eggs, and put into a hot oven. When the
eggs are cooked sufficiently, cover them with
a layer of bread-crumbs that have been fried
in butter, and serve. The bread-crumbs must
be hot, of course. Try this some day at
luncheon when you are having broiled pigs&rsquo;
feet and potato croquettes.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Egg Toast
with Cheese</div>

<p>And if it doesn&rsquo;t turn out the success you
hoped, the next day you might take some very
thin slices of bread, trim off the crusts, lay
on a well-buttered dish, and cover with very
thin slices of cheese. Beat up well enough
eggs to cover the bread, season with salt
and a little cayenne pepper, and pour them
over the slices. Put the dish in a moderate
oven and bake until the eggs are set. Serve
while very hot in the same dish. If you
prefer, you may use in place of the sliced
cheese some grated Parmesan cheese sprinkled
over the bread, and sprinkle a little over the
eggs too.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Eggs in
Tomato
Pur&eacute;e</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>58]</a></span>
Eggs scrambled in tomato pur&eacute;e make a
delectable dish for luncheon, or for dinner as
an entr&eacute;e. Have half a pint of rich tomato
pur&eacute;e, and cook in it half-a-dozen well beaten
eggs; pour the whole into a deep dish, and
serve with it some bread croutons. Some
finely cut up chives will at times be thought
an improvement to this dish.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Scrambled
Eggs with
Truffles</div>

<p>And there are scrambled eggs with truffles
that are good enough for any time or place.
Cook four sliced truffles in a wineglass of
Madeira for about two minutes; then put in
a tablespoonful of butter, and season with
salt and white pepper. Break eight eggs
and without beating stir them well with a
wooden spoon in the wine for three minutes,
cooking quickly all the while. Serve in a
hot dish.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Caviare
Omelets</div>

<p>If one is fond of caviare (and who isn&rsquo;t
nowadays?), an omelet with caviare is most
tempting. Make an omelet of the desired
number of eggs, and just before folding over
spread it with a layer of caviare diluted with
a little b&eacute;chamel sauce. After the omelet is
dished, garnish with parsley.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Spanish
Omelet</div>

<p>You will find in your hunts for Spanish
omelet recipes that they will turn up as thick
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>59]</a></span>
as bees in a hive, after which you will let the
different directions for this savory dish foment
in your mind till you get what seems to be
the best from each and turn out one that is
your very own, and entitled to be known to
your friends as &ldquo;Spanish omelet <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">&agrave; la</i> Madame
Featherstonaugh&rdquo;&mdash;or whatever name has
the honor to belong to you. My recipe you
shall have till you get one of your own, however.
To begin with, have a rich tomato
pur&eacute;e; to this you add chopped pimentos or
sweet Spanish peppers <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">con amore</i>, then a bit
of fried chopped onion, a few mushrooms,
also cooked, and diced cold cooked tongue or
ham, preferably tongue. Take any liberties
with it that you like, pray. Don&rsquo;t think you
must follow it to the letter. I rarely do, to be
candid with you. I have used cold chicken,
cold duck, and also cold goose, when the larder
has been bereft of ham or tongue; and not
one of my household dared to say anything
shady about it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Omelet with
Chicken
Liver</div>

<p>Of course, every housekeeper has a chicken
liver omelet recipe among her belongings,
and made in the most ordinary way they are
pretty sure to be worth the eating; but if the
livers are cooked in a little butter, and then
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>60]</a></span>
a little Madeira is added to the butter, the
omelet is far and away ahead of those made by
ordinary recipes, as you will see by trying
it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Jelly Omelet</div>

<p>When it comes to an omelet for dessert,
nothing can be better than an omelet stuffed
with preserves or fresh fruit. If preserves are
used, there&rsquo;s a wide range from which to
select, and any taste can be satisfied. Fill it
with currant jelly, or apricot or grapefruit
marmalade, or any other fruit that you like.
In almost any case a little grated lemon peel
and a handful of chopped almonds will be
an improvement. After the omelet is dished
it should always be sprinkled with finely
powdered sugar.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Strawberry
Omelet</div>

<p>You might in the way of fresh fruits
use some of the strawberries that are of respectable
flavor and price now. Get a box
some day of the best-looking ones you can
find, and sort them over. Save out about
half of them, the fairest ones in the lot,
cut in halves, and put them in a bowl with
two heaping tablespoonfuls of sugar, a piece
of orange peel, and two teaspoonfuls of rum,
and set them in a cool place. Press the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>61]</a></span>
remainder of the strawberries through a fine
sieve, and sweeten well. Make an omelet
of six eggs, and before folding over fill it
with the cut-up strawberries, without any of
the liquid. Dish the omelet, sprinkle with
powdered sugar, and pour around it the juice
of the strawberries, to which has been added
the liquid from the halved strawberries. It&rsquo;s
a delicate dish, indeed, and you will find that
it will be a favorite at any table.</p>

<div class="sidenote">C&eacute;lestine
Omelet</div>

<p>If you have a recipe for C&eacute;lestine omelets,
small ones, of which you are very much enamored,
this paragraph will not interest you.
But if you are at odds with the one you have,
glance through this. Make as many small
omelets as you think will be required, one egg
to each, with yolk and white beaten separately.
Put them on a hot dish, cover with a thin layer
of peach marmalade, and on this sprinkle
chopped candied fruits with a few chopped
almonds, and over all spread whipped cream.
Work at chain-lightning speed in preparing
this after the omelets are dished, and get to
the table in even quicker time, if you would
know this dish in perfection. Though if
anything happens to cause you to slacken
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>62]</a></span>
your pace a bit, it will be worth the having,
for it will bear shading down a trifle from the
top-notch. Or, make the eggs into one large
omelet, and before folding it over fill with the
jam and fruits, and sprinkle the almonds and
whipped cream over it after it is dished.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Snow Eggs</div>

<p>Then there&rsquo;s a dish called &ldquo;Snow Eggs&rdquo;
that&rsquo;s just as inoffensive as it sounds. You
beat the whites of four eggs to a stiff froth,
and then drop them a spoonful at a time into
boiling milk till they poach a bit. Take them
out, thicken the milk with the yolks, adding
sugar and any desired flavoring. Pour this
over the poached whites, dish, and sprinkle
with chopped macaroons before serving.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Omelette
Souffl&eacute;e</div>

<p>It wouldn&rsquo;t be fair to omit any mention
of an omelette souffl&eacute;e in a chapter on eggs;
so here it shall go, though for myself I don&rsquo;t
care for it. It has always seemed to me like
a dessert to be served when a dessert wasn&rsquo;t
really needed or wanted, but because a dessert
of some kind must go down to make the
luncheon or dinner complete. Separate, then,
the yolks and whites of five eggs. Beat the
yolks and half a cup of sugar together for
ten minutes. Flavor with a little rose-water.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>63]</a></span>
Then turn to the whites, and beat them to
the stiffest kind of a froth. Butter a souffl&eacute;
dish, and pour the mixture into it. Bake
for twelve minutes, and send to table. The
guests should always be waiting for an omelette
souffl&eacute;e, mind. Never force the omelet to do
the waiting&mdash;it isn&rsquo;t giving it a fair chance.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE very first thing to be done on
Easter morning is to get up in time
to see the sun dance; for, as you
probably know, not a bit of good luck will
be yours for the year to come if laziness,
or anything, in fact, save cloudy skies, prevents
your beholding this phenomenon. But
it is possible that you don&rsquo;t know that this
means nothing less than to be facing the east
with eagle eye and steady nerve at a pretty
early hour. Rather rough, isn&rsquo;t it? How
would it do, then, to sit up all night in order
to be on hand to witness the fancy steps
of the god of day? You could do that and
then have a good long nap, after which you
might be refreshed by a breakfast of shad roes
(they&rsquo;re about as inexpensive now as they
will be), broiled to a turn, with a little melted
butter and lemon juice, judiciously mixed,
poured over them; dainty, crisp lettuce hearts,
salted a bit; graham bread, thinly sliced,
and toasted to that shade known the world
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>65]</a></span>
over as &ldquo;epicurean brown;&rdquo; and lastly,
instead of coffee, a steaming, fragrant, appetizing
cup of English breakfast tea. My
word for it, you will be tempted to linger
over this breakfast, but stern duty permits no
such loitering. No, indeed; you must be up
and away, or how on earth are you going to
make certain comparisons that shall confirm
you in your belief that your new bonnet is
nothing less than a dream? Dear knows, I
hope you won&rsquo;t see any headgear that will
take the shine off your own, for then you will
be sure to go home out of sorts, and the
charming little dinner menu that I have compiled
for your use and behoof might as well
be of corned beef and cabbage for all the
appreciation it will get from you.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Clam
Cocktails</div>

<p>But in case that everything does go
smoothly, and nothing happens to nick your
peace of mind, could anything be more delectable
than a dinner which would unfold
itself to your delighted palate in this order?
To begin with: Clam cocktails, made, of
course, with the little-neck variety; they
should be put in half-dozen lots into small
glasses, and seasoned with lemon juice, tabasco,
salt, and the tiniest suspicion of onion juice&mdash;just
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>66]</a></span>
enough, you understand, to cause one to
wonder if that delightful flavor is really onion.</p>

<p>And then to follow up the good impression
left by the clam cocktails, have a soup of consomm&eacute;
of perfect flavor and delicacy&mdash;the
sort, you know, that doesn&rsquo;t jar with what
has gone before or is to come.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;to come&rdquo; in this case might be,
say, of trout, broiled to a nicety and served
with tartar sauce. But if for financial reasons
you object to the trout, why, then you may get
good salmon from the West, or pompano, and
bluefish of fairly good flavor. But whatever
fish you decide upon, have it broiled, so that
you may serve it with some delicious hothouse
cucumbers. Quite a little fall in the price of
cucumbers you will see within the next two
or three weeks.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Lamb Steak<br />
<br />
B&eacute;arnaise
Sauce</div>

<p>And the price of spring lamb has dropped
perceptibly too by this time. Now, please,
whichever part of the lamb you select, don&rsquo;t
have it roasted. Have it sliced for steaks, and
broiled to the stage most in favor in your
family circle, then salted well, but buttered
sparingly, as you must&mdash;there is no use in
trying to dodge the issue&mdash;serve a B&eacute;arnaise
sauce with lamb steak. Have lobster salad
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>67]</a></span>
without the lobster, omit the crabs from devilled
crabs, if it pleases you, but never under
any circumstances serve a lamb steak without
a B&eacute;arnaise sauce. It would be barbarism&mdash;nothing
short of it! And to make the sauce?
Well, put into a saucepan a gill of vinegar and
water, equal parts, half a teaspoonful of minced
onion, and a few tarragon leaves. Let this cook,
tightly covered, till reduced one-half; then
take it off the fire, and when cold mix with it
the well-beaten yolks of four eggs; season
with salt and mignonette, and return to the
fire; add slowly to it three ounces of melted
butter, stirring continually till it thickens to
the consistency of mayonnaise. Then strain
it through a fine sieve, and add to it chopped
tarragon, a teaspoonful, and the same quantity
of chopped parsley.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Potatoes
Souffl&eacute;es</div>

<p>And there&rsquo;s just one way to cook potatoes
so that they seem quite good enough to accompany
a lamb steak, and that way is called
potatoes souffl&eacute;es. The potatoes should be
trimmed to ovals two and a quarter inches
long by one and a quarter wide, and then
sliced lengthwise, having the slices half an
inch in thickness. When they are sliced,
put them into ice-water to remain twenty-five
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>68]</a></span>
minutes. Then have ready two pans of frying
fat, one just hot and the other piping hot.
Into the former put the potatoes, in a frying-basket,
and let them cook without browning
till tender; take them out, place on a
sieve to cool and dry somewhat, and then
plunge them into the pan containing the
piping hot fat; stir them about, and they will
begin to souffler; then they must be taken
out, salted and served.</p>

<p>Now, if anything happens to prevent this
course from turning out the howling success
that I predict for it, I want you to go to my
favorite dining place the next time you are in
New York and order &ldquo;the same.&rdquo; You will
know then what these two dishes are in
perfection.</p>

<p>It may be that a salad of new beets would
be quite the thing on this occasion; if so, you
will have no trouble in finding them in good
condition, and as sweet as a new beet should be.</p>

<p>Here endeth my part of the lesson.</p>

<p>Set your own pace for a dessert.</p>

<hr class="break" />

<p>Although I am prepared to sit up nights
to sympathize with any one who is really deserving
of having me share that emotion with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>69]</a></span>
her, I don&rsquo;t have a particle of desire to weep
with the woman who weeps because visitors
have dropped in on her suddenly and caught
her with her cupboard bare. In these days
of canned things the woman whose larder
doesn&rsquo;t boast as a continuous performance at
least half a dozen varieties was never meant
for a housekeeper.</p>

<p>For my part, I should think I was remiss
in the duties of a housekeeper if I did not
have half a dozen varieties of canned soup
alone from which to select in time of need.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sardine
Toast</div>

<p>Start, then, we will say, an impromptu lunch
with a soup canned by any one of the sixteen
firms, more or less, that so prepare them. Of
course, there will be sardines&mdash;the stand-by of
all housekeepers; but you will have sardine
toast&mdash;a rarity with almost every one. Wipe
the skin off the sardines with a dry cloth. The
toasted bread is free from all crust, mind, and
it is spread with butter mixed with lemon
juice and chopped parsley. The sardines are
laid on it, and the whole arrangement set in
the oven to heat.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Anchovy
Toast</div>

<p>Just as tempting a bouch&eacute;e is an anchovy
toast. Chop the anchovies, and add to them
bits of parsley, a suspicion of onion juice, a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>70]</a></span>
few drops of lemon juice, and some paprika.
Spread this on toast which has been buttered,
and heat quickly in the oven.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Tunny-Fish</div>

<p>Then, there&rsquo;s tunny-fish always to be
depended upon to furnish an impromptu
dish that seems like one planned long before.
Drain it from the oil in which it is preserved.
Lay it on a dish, sprinkle with lemon juice,
chopped parsley, and capers; and keep your
eyes open for the admiring glances your guests
will be trying to hide from you when they
first taste of it.</p>

<p>Then smoked, boneless herring, you know,
are good almost any way; but broiled till
they curl up a bit over a hot fire, and
sent to table flanked by olives, water crackers,
and a bottle or two of lager beer, they are
leaders.</p>

<p>Of course, with two or three kinds of
devilled meats in the house the making of
sandwiches, even at short notice, is just a pastime;
and with all the crackers now to be had
it would be foolish to waste tears over the absence
of bread. In fact, the world, the market,
and the grocery store are filled to the
brim with substitutes nowadays&mdash;substitutes
that make it easy to forget originals.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>71]</a></span>
Although &rsquo;tis by signs of promises soon to
be richly fulfilled that a market interests me
chiefly at this season, there is no lack even
to-day of a good supply of edibles, both substantial
and delicate, and do I go a-marketing
determined to buy everything on an economical
basis I find Dame Nature and the marketman
in league to help me furnish forth my
table daintily and inexpensively. Or, if in a
reckless mood of extravagance I betake myself
to the vendor of viands, I find him and
the dear old dame quite as helpful in carrying
out my plans.</p>

<p>Naturally, in trips to market, my methodical
mind leads me to inquire first what is suitable
for breakfast; what is best calculated to
minister to an appetite capricious in the fickle
springtime. Numerous answers are forthcoming
to my inquiry, the first of which says
shad roes made into delicious croquettes with
a garnishing of lettuce hearts. Very good, I
say, very appropriate, but what else is there?&mdash;every
one doesn&rsquo;t care for that dish. And
then, taking the matter into my own hands,
as the marketman is perfectly willing that I
should, I peer around to see what is to be
had, and make notes mentally for future use.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>72]</a></span>
There are mackerel of finest flavor, which, if
broiled to a turn and having as an accompaniment
crisp, fresh radishes, are fit to put before
a king. Another breakfast dish, which is also
quite good enough for any royal person, is of
kidneys broiled on skewers with alternate
slices of bacon. A bit of parsley serves not
only to decorate this last dish, but forms a
piquant relish for it, and relishes for breakfast
dishes are more of a necessity now than at
any other season. The orange juice which
has proved so potent an appetizer when the
mercury ranges near to zero, fails to supply
the needed zest for a springtime morning meal,
and we must have recourse to a fresh green
vegetable, in addition.</p>

<p>From breakfast fare to luncheon dishes I
turn my attention logically, and learn that
sweetbreads are particularly fine just now in
whatever way they are served, but in my
opinion they are never quite so good as when
simmered gently in butter and served with
cream sauce, to which has been added a few
fresh mushrooms.</p>

<p>Spring chickens, tender and toothsome if
broiled as they should be, are worthy of an
honored place at any luncheon, and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>73]</a></span>
marketman tells me those lately received are of
excellent quality.</p>

<p>That dainty of dainties, in the estimation
of many people, frogs&rsquo; legs, if broiled or served
with a cream sauce, appeals to the most fastidious
palate. And just now they are not
only plentiful and in fine condition, but are
quite inexpensive.</p>

<p>A dish which we cannot always obtain, and
which is especially suitable for a midday meal,
is of the Taunton River alewives smoked;
they should be broiled, and there should be
served with them, without fail, a potato salad
made from the Bermuda potatoes, which are
exceptionally desirable at this season.</p>

<p>In the ordering of a dinner I have always
maintained that though it consists of only
two courses, there is an opportunity for the
exercise of great discretion. A knowledge of
the eternal fitness of things is essential above
all else in order to arrange a dinner at
which the courses shall not be at war with
each other. A certain famous lawyer remarked
in my hearing not long ago that &ldquo;he
knew women who could play whist and play
it as it should be, and he knew women who
could order a dinner fit for the gods, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>74]</a></span>
never had he known and never did he expect
to know, a woman who could do both.&rdquo; Perhaps
he was right, but I believe there are
women in plenty who are quite capable of
doing both to perfection.</p>

<p>At this season, with oysters almost out of
the running, little-neck clams may be depended
upon to whet the appetite, while the soup
which follows must be at once delicate and
yet so rich that the first spoonful enchants.
If the next course is to be of bluefish, or of
salmon, or of striped bass, all of which are in
first-class condition in this month, potatoes
should be served in any desired shape if the
fish is to be boiled or braised; should it be
broiled or fried, then by all means let its
accompaniment be cucumbers, which are plentiful,
and are sold at a comparatively low
figure, by now.</p>

<p>If you follow my advice you will avoid the
heavy, clumsy, and unimaginative joint. Decide
rather upon ducklings to be roasted or
broiled, or upon squabs; or, if these are a
thought too expensive, choose fowl, which
should be good and plentiful. Have it parboiled
and then fried Maryland style, or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>75]</a></span>
fricasseed, or boil it till quite tender and serve
with a caper sauce.</p>

<p>As for vegetables, just now, and for several
weeks to come, nothing can be better than
asparagus, which improves, and is less expensive
every day. Frequently I tire of it served
on toast, in which case, after boiling it, I
moisten it with melted butter, sprinkle grated
Parmesan over the top and brown it in the
oven. Or, if I wish to serve it as a salad, I
have it ice-cold and pour over it a dressing
made of oil, vinegar, pepper, and salt, with a
suspicion of French mustard added.</p>

<p>For salads, tomatoes, perhaps, have first
choice, for they are really very fine, coming
in from the hothouses fresh every day. Watercress
is at its best estate, and whether it be
served as a salad or taken simply with a grain
of salt, it is a delicacy worthy of honor.</p>

<p>It is hardly possible to serve fruit out of
place at dinner; before the soup it is appetizing,
as a compote for an entr&eacute;e it is highly
delectable, while at dessert its presence is
time-honored, and I would that there were
more varieties in market just now. However,
the strawberries and pineapples due are quite
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>76]</a></span>
sufficient to console us for the absence of
other fruits.</p>

<p>With that most delicious vegetable asparagus
as good and as plenty as it is bound to
be for two months or so longer, it is but a
waste of time to search for any other vegetable
to take its place. The truth is, it hasn&rsquo;t a
rival, and it never had one&mdash;even in Pliny&rsquo;s
day, when it grew wild. But gardeners in those
days cultivated it just as they do now, and it
was no uncommon thing for them to produce
stalks of which it took but three to weigh a
pound. If any gardeners do raise such mammoth
specimens in these days they keep very
quiet about it. But perhaps they don&rsquo;t taste any
better than smaller ones. Why should they?</p>

<p>It will do to have asparagus boiled, just
plainly boiled, two out of every three times
that you have it. But the third times are
those of which I would talk.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Asparagus
Tips in
Cream</div>

<p>Suppose you cut off the tips into inch
lengths, and boil very slowly in salted water
till tender. Then drain and let get perfectly
cold, after which you brown them a bit in
butter in a frying pan. At the first threat to
become brown cover the asparagus with cream,
heat well and serve on toasted bread.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Asparagus
with Savory
Sauce</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>77]</a></span>If this doesn&rsquo;t satisfy you for a third try
another way. Cut the asparagus up just the
same and boil with it a few new green peas
and some shredded lettuce. Season with pepper
and salt, and flavor with a few drops of
onion juice. Add an ounce or two of melted
butter to them after draining off the water in
which they were boiled, pour over them half
a pint of white sauce thickened, and then go
ahead with the serving on toast.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Baked
Asparagus</div>

<p>Then you can boil the asparagus tips and
heap them mound shape in a baking dish,
pour through them a Hollandaise or a B&eacute;arnaise
sauce, cover the top with grated Parmesan
cheese and brown in a hot oven.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Asparagus
Salad</div>

<p>But for asparagus salad be sure that after
the tips are taken from the boiling water they
are plunged into ice water. Then cover, when
serving, with a French dressing in which has
been stirred a little French mustard.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Asparagus
Salad 2</div>

<p>Or take some asparagus tips boiled and
cooled and serve them on shaved ice with a
dressing of salt, lemon juice, and horse-radish, or
tabasco, and with a little bit of your most charming
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">persiflage</i> you will be able to persuade some
of your followers that you have produced an
excellent substitute for little-neck clams.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">I</span>T&rsquo;S the month when, by a logical amount
of reasoning, the housekeeper is persuaded
that she can easily treat her
family to roasted veal, at least once a week,
without any member of it entering a complaint.
She tries it. The second time serving
it threatens to go a-begging, and the third
time there is so much left over that it can&rsquo;t
be worked up in seven days&mdash;when, by her
reckoning, another knuckle is due. People
do tire of veal in short order, even those who
have a liking for it, for some reason or other.
I am inclined to think that a good many times
the &ldquo;tired feeling&rdquo; sets in because of the way
it is served&mdash;not enough is done to prepare
the palate for it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Olives with
Caviare</div>

<p>Veal, then, more than any other roast, needs
to have the way prepared for it, very gingerly
and very delicately. Let us discuss a way
for doing this. First, have pitted olives that
you have filled with caviare. Rest these olives
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>79]</a></span>
on little rounds of toast that have been spread
with caviare, and sprinkled with lemon juice.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Pur&eacute;e of
Peas and
Spinach</div>

<p>Now, for a soup. Soak over night a pint of
green dried peas. Drain, and cook in plenty
of fresh water till perfectly tender. Then press
through a sieve. Have cooked, at the same
time, a peck of spinach, and press through a
sieve also. Then put the two pur&eacute;es together,
season with salt and pepper; heat well,
adding half a pint of milk. Just before
taking up, pour in a pint of cream, and serve
with tiny squares of fried bread in the tureen.
Ever heard of this before? It&rsquo;s a soup that
is rich and delicate, but not so hearty that it
does more than whet the appetite for what is
to follow.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Mayonnaise
with Horse-Radish</div>

<p>Shall we say salmon comes next? It&rsquo;s a
thought high as yet, perhaps, but you only
need a little of it&mdash;a pound for four, where
a roast is to follow. But, to tell the truth,
my insisting on your having it comes almost
wholly from a desire I have to tell you of a
new sauce for boiled or broiled salmon. It is
nothing more than mayonnaise, a half pint,
with a heaping tablespoonful of horse-radish
stirred through it. Oh, you will like it fast
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>80]</a></span>
enough! And you will like it with cold
salmon, just as well.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Duchesse
Sauce</div>

<p>By the time the fish is a thing of the past,
you will all be ready for the roasted veal.
On this, of course, you have had tied thin
slices of salt pork before it is roasted. With
it, will you have a duchesse sauce? I think
you will. For this you have a pint of good
stock, thickened a bit with butter braided with
flour. After it is heated, there is added to it
a wineglass of any white wine.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Onion Sauce</div>

<p>Or, if I have made a mistake, and you will
have none of it, do let me suggest an onion
sauce. Peel and chop three onions, and let
simmer in plenty of butter, closely covered,
for an hour. Let them brown, a trifle,
at the last, and add a tablespoonful of flour
with pepper and salt. Then add to them half
a pint each of white stock and cream. Pour
this into the pan in which the veal was roasted,
after it is taken out, set the pan on top of the
range and let boil gently for five minutes.
It&rsquo;s an improved sauce Soubise, you may say,
if any of your guests are led to ask the name
of it. But, if they ask for directions for making
it, don&rsquo;t give them up. Advise, instead,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>81]</a></span>
buying this book to learn, as you did, how to
concoct such a bit of deliciousness.</p>

<p>Really, I wouldn&rsquo;t have more than one vegetable
with the veal, and that asparagus, as
it&rsquo;s the season for it. Or, have something
else, if you prefer, and have an asparagus
salad.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Rhubarb
Sherbet</div>

<p>For the dessert, why not a rhubarb sherbet?
Cut up two pounds of it, and boil
with a few drops of water and plenty of sugar,
the rind of a lemon, and a little liquid carmine
to color it prettily. Let this get cool; strain
through a sieve, and add to it a pint of claret
and two tablespoonfuls of rum. Freeze, and
have ready to decorate it, when serving, some
strips of candied ginger. You will find it all
that you have reason to think it should be,
coming from this source.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Apricot
Charlotte</div>

<p>But, if you prefer an apricot charlotte, it
shall be my pleasure to tell you how to make
one. Line the same charlotte mould you
always use with sponge drops, or fingers, carefully
trimmed to fit. In fact, you want to
give them a regular tailor-made fit. Then fill
with a pint of preserved apricots, which have
been stewed till tender enough to rub through
a sieve. Stir into it an ounce of gelatine,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>82]</a></span>
dissolved in a little water. Let it get perfectly
cool, and then whip into it a pint of already
whipped cream. Turn into the mould and
set away to harden. And you have the most
ungrateful family in the neighborhood if they
don&rsquo;t count this dinner as a red-letter event
in their lives.</p>

<hr class="break" />

<p>Think you that upon one of these mornings,
when the mercury shows a sullen determination
to do nothing but climb, climb, climb,
you can prepare a more tempting dish for
breakfast than one of shrimps, which have
been boiled in fresh water, then salted and
cooled, and finally sent to table upon chopped
ice? You will find them at the market for
the rest of this month, at least, in excellent
condition, and at a reasonable price. And
should you elect to serve them according to
the foregoing suggestion, place near them on
the table a dish of crisp, fresh watercress,
lightly piled, ministering thereby to the eye&rsquo;s
pleasure as well as to the appetite&rsquo;s desire.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Broiled Veal
Cutlets</div>

<p>But if, some fine morning, a breath of winter
comes o&rsquo;er the land, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">via</i> an east wind, then
you will, perhaps, crave food served hot, in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>83]</a></span>
which case have veal cutlets (veal is in fine
shape now); dip them in melted butter and
then broil over the coals; you will find this
an infinitely better way of cooking them than
by frying, which so many housekeepers consider
the standard method. Or, if you do
not care for veal, try thin slices of bacon,
broiled, and served on toasted graham bread.
As a fruit, for leading up to either of these
dishes, I think you will prefer pineapples, for
they are of delicious quality now, and sold at
a price which also recommends them to your
notice. Quite as appetizing, however, you
might find cherries, but, though they are of
fairly good flavor, they are a bit expensive, as
they have a right to be, coming from such a
distance.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Herring
Salad</div>

<p>It is with intent and purpose that I do not
suggest that everlasting Americanism, beefsteak
for breakfast; to my mind, it seems far
more suitable for the luncheon table, and just
now, with mushrooms so plenty, and as inexpensive
as they ever are, a well-broiled, tender,
juicy sirloin steak, with a mushroom sauce,
makes a dish fit for the gods, and yet not a whit
too good for human nature&rsquo;s daily food. Just
as good, in its way, for luncheon, is a herring
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>84]</a></span>
salad, made of smoked herring. Omit the
use of caviare, which many cook-books recommend,
for you want nothing that will encroach
upon the flavor of the herring, but
rather something which will act as its complement.
For this purpose use one-third cold
sliced potatoes to two-thirds herring, a plentiful
sprinkling of capers, and the ordinary
oil and vinegar dressing, with the salt put in
by a miserly hand. Another salad, suitable for
luncheon, especially if cold tongue is served,
is made of the little Bermuda onions, which
are abundant now; they should be minced
finely and served ice-cold to win your highest
admiration.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Baked
Chicken Hash</div>

<p>And now, just one more dish before
leaving the luncheon table. Have you ever
prepared a baked-chicken hash? If not,
allow me to suggest that you chop quite finely
the cold meat of chicken or fowl, season it
with salt and white pepper, moisten it with
cream or with milk and butter, scatter bread-crumbs
over the top and brown in the oven,
and behold, you have one of the homeliest
dishes in the annals of housekeepers glorified
to suit the palate of a veritable epicure.</p>

<p>Whenever, at this season of the year, I go
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>85]</a></span>
to market in search of fish for the dinner-table,
it is only by the exercise of great will power
that I am able to refrain from buying soft-shell
crabs. They are so delicious, whether broiled
or fried, that it seems positively wicked they
should be so expensive. Still, the fish dealer
assures me that almost any day the price
may &ldquo;break&rdquo; and, other fish being plentiful,
we can afford to wait patiently for the &ldquo;drop.&rdquo;
Delicious trout, of either the lake or brook
variety, are abundant, and in whatever way
they are served are one of the pleasures of the
present day.</p>

<p>Although the month of roses is generally
known as the month of salmon, it is in first-class
condition now, and obtainable at a fairly
low figure. No other fish is so capable of reserving;
little scraps left may be warmed in
cream and served on toast for breakfast, made
into a salad for luncheon, or shaped into croquettes
for dinner the following day.</p>

<p>In the vernacular of the marketman, &ldquo;spring
lamb is getting down on to the earth.&rdquo; Which,
being interpreted for ears polite, means that
the price is getting lower each week, but that
the flavor remains unsurpassed; in fact &ldquo;none
but itself can be its parallel.&rdquo; Bits of lamb
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>86]</a></span>
left from dinner may be prepared in the way
suggested for baked-chicken hash, and will, I
am sure, merit your favor.</p>

<p>When lamb is suggested, there follows, as
a natural sequence, the thought of green peas;
and if the peas in market to-day were only as
good as they look, the thought would be a
happy one. As matters stand, however, for
those who know not the delight of eating peas
in less than three hours from the time they
are gathered from the vines, the representatives
of this vegetable to be had now will pass
muster. For myself, I prefer either cauliflower
or egg plant, both of them plenty and
in good condition now. The former if boiled
and served with a white sauce, or baked with
cheese is especially gratifying when served
with a roast of lamb, while the egg-plant will
be quite as much of a success if broiled, or
stuffed and baked.</p>

<p>Of course asparagus has attained perfection,
and is so in evidence on every hand that it is
not necessary to mention it here. However,
there are many persons of the belief that it is
impossible to have too much of a good thing,
and most decidedly asparagus is entitled to
come under that head.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Savory
Tomato Soup</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>87]</a></span>
Shall I tell you of three little dinners and
how to make them grow? Give ear, then,
and you may hear. The first shall have a
foundation of tomato soup. Now please
don&rsquo;t make a wry face and begin to say unkind
things about tomato soup having a past
until you have heard me through; for I want
to tell you of an economical and really delicious
way of making this soup that is not
known to every one. Just at this season
almost all housekeepers will be sure to have
on hand two or three kinds of cooked vegetables,
little scraps of each I mean. Now,
suppose the list to comprise three new potatoes,
boiled, half a cupful of string beans and
about the same quantity of green peas; to
these, or to any others which you may prefer
to use, should be added two raw onions finely
minced and a handful of chopped parsley.
Put them into a saucepan with two ounces of
butter, a sprinkling of pepper and salt, and,
after they have simmered for ten minutes, add
a can of tomatoes. Season then with a teaspoonful
of whole allspice, a tablespoonful of
sugar, and more pepper and salt if need be,
and cook slowly for half an hour. At the
end of that time strain through a fine hair
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>88]</a></span>
sieve, put back on the stove and thicken
with a scant teaspoonful of cornstarch mixed
with a teaspoonful of melted butter. Have
little sippets of fried bread in the soup tureen,
pour the soup over them and serve. And
there you have a soup possessed of all the
flavors that make a tomato soup worth the eating,
while it has none of the heaviness of
soup made with a rich stock.</p>

<p>And the next dish for dinner No. 1 shall
be of dainty little lamb chops broiled to a
turn. Have in the centre of the platter a
mound of mashed potato, lean the chops
against it, and serve in this way.</p>

<p>With the chops serve string beans. Boil
them till tender in salted water, drain them
and put into a saucepan with two ounces
of butter and two tablespoonfuls of cream to a
quart of beans. Cook them for three minutes
and send to the table very hot.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Asparagus
Salad</div>

<p>It would be a sin and a shame to arrange a
dinner at this time of year without providing
for the serving of asparagus. Even though
the dinner is to consist of one course only,
that course should be of asparagus. But in
the dinner which we are now planning it is to
make its appearance at the third course as a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>89]</a></span>
salad. It must be boiled till quite tender,
then chilled for three or four hours on the ice,
cut into inch lengths, and served with a dressing
of the yolks of three hard-boiled eggs
beaten up with three tablespoonfuls of oil, two
tablespoonfuls of vinegar, a saltspoonful of
salt and the same quantity of French mustard.</p>

<p>The last course shall include strawberries
served in some way. Have them plain, with
sugar and cream, and serve with them narrow
strips of delicate puff paste; or make little
tartlets, and when they are done lift the covers
and put a teaspoonful of whipped cream
into each.</p>

<p>And the cost of dinner No. 1? Well, at
the price of &ldquo;comestible wares&rdquo; at this season,
this dinner should not cost over one dollar for
four persons. And really it will not require
very close figuring to bring it within that sum.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Bisque of
Clams</div>

<p>But if that seems too small an amount to
expend for a dinner intended to give pleasure
to four persons, there will be no trouble in
planning one to cost rather more. And for
the first course let us have a bisque of clams.
Get a quart of clams and a small piece of veal,
about a pound of it. Cook the veal in a little
more than a pint of water and the liquor
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>90]</a></span>
drained from the clams. Season with one
onion, a sprig of parsley, a bay leaf, salt, and
white pepper. Cook very slowly for one
hour, then strain and again place it in
the kettle; rub a couple of tablespoonfuls
of butter with an equal amount of flour and
add to the soup when boiling. Chop up
the clams very fine, and put them into the
soup; let it boil for five minutes and then add
half a pint of cream. Heat thoroughly, but
don&rsquo;t let it boil after adding the cream, and
serve. And after you have partaken of this
I&rsquo;ll warrant you will be ready to declare
that Grimod de la Reyni&egrave;re had this especial
kind of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">potage</i> in mind when he said: &ldquo;Soup
is not only the commencement of a feast, but
gives an idea of what is to follow.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="sidenote">Asparagus
Tops with
Cheese</div>

<p>And its close follower in this instance
should be some delicious little ducklings
roasted. With the ducklings have new potatoes,
from Bermuda or from the South,
plainly boiled. And have, too, some asparagus&mdash;asparagus
tops with cheese. Cut the
tender part of the asparagus into inch lengths
and cook in salted water till fairly tender;
then drain and toss it about over the fire in
a frying-pan with a little butter. Dress it on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>91]</a></span>
a vegetable dish, spread the surface smoothly
with butter into which has been kneaded an
equal quantity of grated Parmesan cheese and
just a suspicion of cayenne pepper. Brown
as quickly as you can in a piping hot oven,
and serve.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Lettuce
Salad with
Chives</div>

<p>And now for the salad. Does one of lettuce
strike you favorably? If so, prepare it
with a French dressing, as you always do, but
after it is dressed sprinkle over it all some
finely chopped chives. My word for it,
you&rsquo;ll find this a great improvement over the
ordinary lettuce salad.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Frozen
Strawberries</div>

<p>A tempting dessert with which to wind up
this dinner would be frozen strawberries with
whipped cream. Let me tell you how to prepare
the dish, and see what you think about
it. Make a syrup of a third of a pint of sugar
and a pint of water. Into the syrup put a
quart of fine ripe strawberries and let boil
for five minutes. Then freeze the mixture.
Whip half a pint of cream, work it into the
strawberries, and serve in as dainty a fashion
as possible.</p>

<p>And the amount of money required to furnish
forth a table with dinner No. 2? Not a
cent over two dollars for four persons.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Asparagus
Soup</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>92]</a></span>
But, for fear that to many that may seem
too small an amount for just the kind of
dinner they want to give, I will try again.
Since we have decided that asparagus must
appear in some form at every dinner while its
season lasts, we will start dinner No. 3 with
asparagus soup. This is made by cooking the
tender parts of the asparagus in salted water
for a few minutes. Before they get quite tender
drain till dry and cold. If there are two
bunches of asparagus put them into a saucepan
with four ounces of butter, two finely chopped
onions, a lump of sugar, and a little white
pepper. Moisten with a pint of white broth
and let cook for ten minutes. Then rub
through a sieve, heat again and serve.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Green Peas
with Mint</div>

<p>After the soup, crabs&mdash;soft-shell crabs
dipped in beaten egg and crumbs and fried.
Serve nothing but tartar sauce with them.
Then have a couple of cunning little spring
chickens broiled. Have new potatoes chopped
and baked in cream served with the chickens,
and have also new green peas. Try boiling
with them a small bunch of mint and a small
onion, both of which are to be removed
before the peas are served. You will find
that the peas have acquired a delightful flavor
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>93]</a></span>
from their contact with the other vegetables.
Of course salt and pepper and butter are to
be added as when they are cooked in the ordinary
way.</p>

<p>For a salad have some hothouse tomatoes
peeled and sliced; lay them on a flat dish, and
on each slice heap a little chopped lettuce
mixed with mayonnaise.</p>

<p>Let us borrow the dessert from dinner
No. 2 to put the finishing touch to this last
dinner. I don&rsquo;t know a better one, but if you
do there&rsquo;s nothing to prevent your using it.</p>

<p>And, do your best, if you are to serve
dinner No. 3 for four persons you cannot
make it cost over three dollars.</p>

<p>Are you satisfied, now, that I know how to
make dinners grow?</p>

<div class="sidenote">Clams West
Island Style</div>

<p><span class="dropcap">C</span>LAMS are good and plentiful now,&rdquo;
said the fish dealer one day, and as
I was in the frame of mind to take
him at his word I hastily ran over in my
mind the various ways in which this delectable
fish may be prepared, the while I ordered
from him the quantity I thought I could use.
It doesn&rsquo;t take very long to sum up the gastronomical
possibilities of the clam that are cherished
in the minds of most housekeepers, you
will admit. But, with time and opportunity
favoring, there is room for expansion of ideas
with regard to clams. For instance, this is
one way to expand: Poach, say, a pint of them
in their own liquor, then drain off the liquor,
adding to the clams milk thickened with egg
yolks and seasoned with pepper and salt;
forget economy and put in the butter you
know it requires to make the flavor perfect,
and on top of all have some tiny rice croquettes.
You can&rsquo;t know till you try it just
what this dish may reveal served at breakfast.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>95]</a></span>
But I will not spoil the story by telling you in
advance. If, however, it&rsquo;s for luncheon that
you would be thinking of having them cooked
in this way, add the juice of an onion to
them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Clam and
Lobster in
Shells</div>

<p>If you trust to me so far as to adopt the foregoing
way of cooking clams you certainly will
try this next way of preparing them at the
slightest provocation. Have as many as you
like and chop them. Add to them an equal
quantity of chopped boiled lobster. Sprinkle
in some parsley, also chopped, and butter to
the amount above recommended. Season
with white pepper and salt, and with the mixture
fill some of the deepest clam shells,
sprinkle bread crumbs over the top and brown
in a hot oven. This may be counted on at
any time for a luncheon dish when you are
planning to go some persons who have entertained
you at least one better.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Stuffed
Baked
Cucumbers</div>

<p>Before I forget it I am going to tell you of
a dish that to my sorrow is rather uncommon,
even among those who think they dine well.
It&rsquo;s nothing less than a stuffed, baked cucumber&mdash;that
is, those are the essentials of the
dish. The potentials are to be classified by
you after you have partaken of it. Cut the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>96]</a></span>
cucumbers in two lengthwise without peeling
them, scoop out all the seeds, and fill to heaping
each half with a highly seasoned mixture
of bread crumbs; moisten with melted butter
and brown in a hot oven. Vary this stuffing
at your own sweet will&mdash;add a few chopped
olives or some chopped pimientos&mdash;Spanish
sweet peppers you know&mdash;but have bread
crumbs enough to insure the dish getting
browned in shape.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Fried
Cucumbers</div>

<p>If the idea of cooking cucumbers assimilates
itself harmoniously with your ideas of
gastronomy you may not hesitate to try a
dish of fried cucumbers. And don&rsquo;t let any
one infect your mind with the idea that they are
especially indigestible. They&rsquo;re not. Peel
them first, then slice them into quarter-inch
slices, say, then dip in beaten egg, then in
crumbs, and then fry to a delicate brown in a
little butter. Try either way of cooking the
cucumbers with a tender spring chicken
broiled. For if you are not deprived of your
rights nowadays you should be finding &ldquo;broilers&rdquo;
in good condition and not too high in
price. You see of game there is little to be
said in the Eastern markets during this
month; so if you are trying to do the handsome
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>97]</a></span>
thing in the bird line you&rsquo;ve not much
of a list from which to make a selection. To
be sure you have a right to inquire at market
for brant just now, come to think of it. You
will be apt to find them, and in good condition,
too. Roasted shall we say? With
them new potatoes of course. Don&rsquo;t tell me
you can&rsquo;t afford them, I know better. And
you can also afford to secure some new summer
squash to go with the roasted brant.
Don&rsquo;t ask me where it comes from. I only
know that in every up-to-date market it is on
sale. So are young, sweet little carrots that
appeal to you for a white cream sauce like
that you serve with cauliflower.</p>

<p>By now you may reasonably be ordering
blackberries if you are longing for a change.
But my advice is to stick to the strawberry
while it will stick to you. By the way, if you
are to &ldquo;do up&rdquo; strawberries, get the first
&ldquo;natives&rdquo; that come to town. Get them, you
know, before they are soft from overripeness,
and next winter when set on your table just
as they are, or with the syrup of them jellied
with a bit of gelatine, you will see the wisdom
of being forehanded with them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>98]</a></span>
&ldquo;Give us breakfasts; tell us housekeepers
what we can put before our families for the
first meal of the day in summer that shall
drive away the morning sulks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thus did a matron young neither in years
nor in experience beseech me as I set out for
market one day. And while I was parleying
with the marketman as to the ways and means
and the whys and wherefores of things edible
that plaintive &ldquo;Give us breakfasts&rdquo; rang so
insistently in my ears that I could pay no
attention to viands essentially suitable for
later meals, but fell to thinking and planning
breakfasts which should be antidotes&mdash;antidotes
for that ill which more than any other
human ailment is strengthened by recognition,
the &ldquo;morning sulks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And my first definite plan took shape in
this wise: Cherries, for this is the month <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">par
excellence</i> for that delicious fruit, cherries with
some green leaves piled upon cracked ice in
such a manner that the sight of them refreshes,
while to taste of them leads one to
think &ldquo;All&rsquo;s well with the world.&rdquo; And
then, to follow, there must be croquettes of
fish; all kinds are so abundant now that it is
only a case of paying one&rsquo;s money and taking
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>99]</a></span>
one&rsquo;s choice. But whatever fish is chosen,
the croquettes should be smaller than those
for use at luncheon or dinner, for the eye is
repelled at breakfast-time by sight of large
portions. With croquettes the daintiest and
lightest parsley omelette imaginable should be
served, it seems to me, and there you have a
simple breakfast, easy of accomplishment, but
one sure to be appreciated by King Sulks
himself.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Iced
Watermelon<br />
<br />
Fried Chicken
with Cream</div>

<p>My second plan, when it assumes tangible
shape, shall be like this: Watermelons, not
cut up into ungainly chunks with juice and
seeds playing at hide-and-seek in one&rsquo;s plate,
but with the pretty pink portion cut into two-inch
cubes, say, with all the seeds removed,
and sent to table after being well cooled, fancifully
piled on shaven ice. If you don&rsquo;t
mind a little fuss and bother, you may after it
is cut up sprinkle the melon well with powdered
sugar, put it into the freezer and frapp&eacute;
but not freeze it, and then send it to table.
To the palates of many of this day and generation
watermelon well chilled comes as a
boon, for the best of men now and then are
afflicted with a thirst these warm mornings
which nothing save ice-water seems to quench,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>100]</a></span>
but the physicians and moralists have held
forth at such length on the subject that one
feels like a guilty thing upon taking a drink
of cold water before breaking fast. Now you
are going to ask what will be quite good
enough to follow watermelon, and for answer
I shall recommend chicken, or fowl, boiled the
previous day, and cut into neat pieces, then
browned well in butter, with hot cream poured
over it just before it is sent to the table. If
you want a delightful adjunct for the chicken,
let it be cold asparagus, with lemon juice and
salt sprinkled over it. If you have never
partaken of cold asparagus at breakfast, there
is a new pleasure in store for you, for good as
this vegetable is hot at dinner or luncheon, it
seems especially apt when served cold in the
morning.</p>

<p>Quite as attractive, and simpler in preparation,
perhaps, you will find my third recipe
for an antidote, it goes something like this:
To begin with, blackberries, growing better
and more abundant every day; to follow the
blackberries smoked beef tossed in hot cream
which has been seasoned with cayenne pepper,
and thickened a trifle with corn starch, and&mdash;as
a complement for the smoked beef you will
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>101]</a></span>
desire something sour&mdash;try watercress dressed
with lemon juice and salt, unless you are so
enamored of tomatoes that you prefer them to
any other vegetable in the morning, now.</p>

<p>My next (really I don&rsquo;t mean this to read
like an enigma) idea if you choose to put it
into action will cause your breakfast table to
answer to this description: Raspberries, sweetened
a bit, tossed in whipped cream and put
into paper cases which come on purpose for
the carrying out of dainty table schemes, and
then chilled on the ice for at least an hour
before serving. Trouble? Oh, yes, there&rsquo;s
some trouble involved, but your reward will
be swift and sure, my word for it. Something
exceptionally dainty and palate-appealing must
follow the raspberries so prepared, and how
does the thought of veal, minced finely and
seasoned perfectly, with poached eggs on top,
coincide with your idea of the fitness of
things?</p>

<div class="sidenote">Ham Toast</div>

<p>Very soon we shall have currants in abundance,
and it has always seemed to me that
when one is to have ham for breakfast they go
particularly well for a first course. And the
ham is entitled to different treatment in summer
from that which it receives in the cold
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>102]</a></span>
weather. For instance, just now if you
have slices of toast and sprinkle lightly
over them grated ham mixed with grated
cheese, and then put them in a hot oven till
the cheese is dissolved, your family will be
your debtor to the extent of one new and distinct
gastronomical emotion.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Gooseberry
Cream</div>

<p>You will soon be able to get desirable gooseberries
in the market, and while the average
housekeeper will be engaged in reckoning their
possibilities if &ldquo;baked in a pie,&rdquo; you will, if you
but follow my advice, cook them in sugar till
tender, strain through a sieve, cool the pur&eacute;e,
then boil it down and cool once more, that it
may be in readiness for the next morning&rsquo;s
breakfast, served with whipped cream flavored
with lemon. You will find that this will pave
the way excellently for a fine bluefish, properly
broiled, and flanked by a tomato omelet.</p>

<p>It is not in my province at present to prescribe
the different cakes, muffins, and rolls
that should accompany the foregoing dishes,
for every cook-book sets forth an array of
such recipes from which to select one for every
day in the year. Neither do I presume to
suggest to any woman in what she shall be
clothed. No, when I go into the subject of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>103]</a></span>
dress for the breakfast table it will be to exploit
my ideas upon the way that men should
array themselves.</p>

<hr class="break" />

<p>Whatever other faults the out-of-season
strawberry may have it cannot be said of it
that it induces satiety. And I wonder if the
season of &ldquo;natives&rdquo; could be long enough to
have that effect on the palate. Probably. But
this isn&rsquo;t the place to go into a discussion of
that side of the question.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Strawberry
Fritters</div>

<p>Serving strawberries is or should be an
every-day occurrence while the season lasts.
I have told you in other places of two or three
ways of serving them that I hope you found
worthy a place among your collection of recipes
for dainty dishes. But I believe I&rsquo;ve
said nothing about strawberry fritters. And
in case you have never tried them let me suggest
that you have them soon prepared
in this way: Get the very largest strawberries
you can find. Take off the hulls and
cover them entirely with any sort of marmalade,
preferably apricot, then roll them in
macaroon crumbs, dip them one at a time into
the lightest frying batter you know how to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>104]</a></span>
make and fry them in very hot fat. Drain
and roll them in powdered sugar before serving.
A really delicious dish you will find
these fritters, quite good enough to be served
at dessert for the very best dinner you know
how to arrange.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Strawberry
Pudding</div>

<p>It comes to pass sometimes, you know,
that one will have on hand a pint or so of
strawberries that can hardly be called <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pass&eacute;e</i>,
still they have lost their pristine freshness and
show symptoms of becoming soft. Well, the
best way to serve them is to heat them through
in a little syrup, not letting them lose their
shape or their color. Then put them into a
pudding dish and cover them with a half-inch
layer of bread-crumbs. Make a custard of
four eggs and a quart of milk, seasoning it
with a little grated nutmeg, pour into the
dish with the berries and bread-crumbs and
bake for half an hour. It may be served
either hot or cold. And you will have reason
to be pleased with yourself for having turned
out an appetizing sweet, and one that will
help you to foster that pet belief of every
housekeeper, namely, that you are past mistress
in the art of domestic economy.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Strawberry
Jelly</div>

<p>Another dainty sweet can be made by mashing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>105]</a></span>
a quart of strawberries with half a pint or so
of sugar, and then letting them stand for half an
hour while you are making a syrup of half a
pint of sugar and the same quantity of water.
When this syrup has boiled twenty minutes
mix with it an ounce of gelatine dissolved in
half a pint of water. Take the syrup from
the fire and strain the strawberries through a
fine sieve into it. Stand the bowl containing
the mixture on the ice and whip briskly for
five minutes, then add the whipped whites of
four eggs and keep right on beating till it has
the grace to thicken. Then turn it into a
number of small moulds or one large one.
When it is to be served unmould on the
prettiest dish you own, sprinkle powdered
sugar over the top and pour a little whipped
cream round in a fanciful shape for a border.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Strawberry
Salad</div>

<p>If you are going to make a strawberry
salad, and I think you will after I tell you
how, you should have the strawberries as fresh
as possible. Cut them in halves, and if they
are the bouncer variety cut them in quarters.
Put them into a basin with as much sugar as
you think they will need; to one quart of
berries add a wineglass of brandy, a tablespoonful
of strained lemon juice, and then
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>106]</a></span>
pack in ice till they are all but frozen. Dish
up in a pile when serving and put a border of
whipped cream round the salad.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Pear Salad</div>

<p>A salad of almost any kind of fruit makes
an appetizing dish for luncheon or for dinner.
One of pears is really delicious if the pears are
peeled, cored, and cut in thin slices, laid in a
dish, sprinkled ever so lightly with powdered
sugar, and have a few drops of brandy or rum
poured over them. Of course this salad, like
all others made of fruit, needs to be thoroughly
chilled before it is served, to have its appetizing
qualities at their best.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Pineapple
Salad</div>

<p>If a pineapple salad seems to you a fitting
dessert for the particular luncheon you have
in mind, it is easily prepared. Be sure that
the pineapples, two of them we&rsquo;ll say, are
perfectly ripe; shred them thoroughly and
throw away the core. Put the shredded fruit
into a deep glass dish, and pour over it a good
half-pint of powdered sugar mixed with a
tablespoon each of brandy and cura&ccedil;oa. This
salad should stand for about three hours before
serving, so that the sugar may become quite
dissolved.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Salad of
Several
Fruits</div>

<p>And a salad of several kinds of fruits makes
an altogether charming dish. Try it some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>107]</a></span>
time. Have half a pound of perfectly ripe
cherries, remove the stalks and stones;
have the same quantity of currants, but have
a part of them red and the other part white,
just to make the dish a bit prettier, and have
a quarter of a pound each of raspberries and
strawberries. Sprinkle over the fruit plenty
of powdered white sugar and three tablespoons
of brandy. Shake about lightly that the
sugar may dissolve before it is served.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Crystallized
Raspberries</div>

<p>Some day when you have been so fortunate
as to get some particularly large and good
raspberries, fix them up in this way: Hull
them, of course, and then dip them one at a
time in the beaten white of an egg mixed with
a tablespoonful of water. As you take the
raspberries from the egg roll them, one at a
time, in powdered sugar and put at short distances
from each other on a sheet of white
paper to become perfectly dry, which will take
two or three hours. When dry keep on ice
till served for dessert. And a dainty dessert
you will find it, my word for it. Strawberries
and blackberries, also, may be treated in the
same way, but I doubt if they will find the
favor that will be shown the raspberries.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Raspberry
Cream</div>

<p>And a raspberry cream is pretty sure to be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>108]</a></span>
a favorite dish in almost any company. It is
very simple, too. Just press the raspberries
through a fine sieve to remove the seeds;
mix in well half a pint of cream and sufficient
sugar to sweeten. Beat it well, and as fast as
froth rises skim it off and put it on a hair
sieve. Put the cream that is left in a glass
dish, pile the whipped cream on the top,
mounting it as high as possible, and serve.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Banana
Cream</div>

<p>Another delicious fruit cream is made by
pressing half a dozen bananas through a fine
hair sieve into a basin, mixing with the fruit
one and one-half pints of cream, flavored with
vanilla, and then passing the whole through a
fine sieve. Freeze the cream a little&mdash;till it
just thickens&mdash;and then add to it a pint of
cream, two tablespoonfuls of sugar and a wineglassful
of Madeira. Keep in the freezer
for two or three hours before serving.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Peach
Cream</div>

<p>This you will find is also a tempting way
in which to make a peach cream, but if the
peaches are not perfectly ripe it will be a good
idea to stew them for two or three minutes in a
little syrup. The peaches, of course, will need
more sugar than the bananas do, but no hard
and fast rule can be given for the amount&mdash;just
sweeten them according to your judgment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>109]</a></span>
Have you noticed that with all I&rsquo;ve had to
say about strawberries herein, not once have
I quoted Dr. Boteler&rsquo;s remark concerning
them? And yet I&rsquo;ve heard it said that a
woman finds it as impossible to refrain from
mentioning the famous saying when writing
about strawberries, if only half a dozen lines,
as does a man to omit all mention of Izaak
Walton when he has anything to say about
going a-fishing.</p>

<div class="i0first">&ldquo;<i>Unlike my subject now shall be my song;</i><br /></div>
<div class="i0"><i>It shall be witty, and it shan&rsquo;t be long.</i>&rdquo;<br /></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>


<p><span class="dropcap">I</span>T was with the thought of Hortensia&rsquo;s
garden party weighing somewhat heavily
on my mind that I made my customary
tour &ldquo;all on a market day,&rdquo; for she
had beseeched me with tears in her voice to
plan for her a list of appetizing dishes to put
before her guests which should not be so
elaborate as though meant for a grand dinner,
nor yet so simple as if intended for the
refreshment of a Sunday-school picnic.</p>

<p>Hortensia would, I felt sure, see to it that
the piazzas, grounds, and tent-like buffet were
so decorated and adorned that one would at
once conclude that Flora herself had taken a
personal interest in the appointments, and I
firmly resolved that, come what would, my
part of the programme should be carried out
in such a manner that reasonable grounds
should be furnished for the supposition that
no less a person than Epicurus had had a
finger in the pie. Therefore it was with a
full appreciation of the responsibility I had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>111]</a></span>
assumed that I opened negotiations with the
marketman.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Roasted
Doe Birds</div>

<p>As all the world knows, a garden party
wouldn&rsquo;t be much of an affair without game,
and fortunately for the hosts and hostesses at
such merrymakings, there are in market at
this season now fine doe birds, which may be
seasoned with a little salt, a suspicion of
Madeira, roasted in a quick oven, and depended
on to furnish delight, when thoroughly
cooled, to the most captious of guests.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Game Tarts</div>

<p>Another delightful manner of serving game
is in the form of tarts&mdash;squab or pigeon
tarts; line the tart moulds with paste, and
then fill with the breasts only of the birds,
adding a few slices of mushrooms and moistening
with a liquor made by boiling the bones
of the birds in a little water well seasoned with
salt, a bit of pepper, and a spoonful or two of
sherry. Cover the tarts with the paste, have
perfectly cold, and unmould before serving.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Turkey in
Aspic</div>

<p>Just now one may find tender and toothsome
young turkeys in the market stalls,
waiting to do duty at any event to which they
may be called, and for the particular occasion
in which we are interested at this instant there
can be no better way of serving them than by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>112]</a></span>
boiling till tender and then cutting into small
pieces, moulding them with the help of aspic
jelly into shapes so attractive that one longs
to learn if they can be quite as gratifying to
the palate as to the eye. And, by the way,
what a godsend aspic jelly is in the preparation
of dishes to be served cold!</p>

<div class="sidenote">Beef Tongue</div>

<p>Another cold dish which is looked upon as
being a sort of commonplace stand-by is of
boiled tongue, but I have found that it is easily
raised to a level bordering on the ideal if prepared
in this way: Boil the beef tongue till
tender in water which has been highly seasoned
with vegetables, herbs, and spice; remove
the skin, brush the tongue with beaten
egg, strew it thickly with bread-crumbs, and
bake for half an hour in a hot oven, basting
frequently with port wine. Let it get perfectly
cold before slicing and have the slices
as thin as possible.</p>

<p>Near to the tongue, as a relish for it, and indeed
for all of the foregoing dishes, one&rsquo;s sense
of the fitness of things approves the idea of
having crisp, thin slices of toast, sprinkled with
the finest little bits of green peppers imaginable,
and masked with a thin layer of mayonnaise.</p>

<p>In fact, one, if not the best, way to serve
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>113]</a></span>
salads at an outdoor festivity, is upon thin
slices of toast of white or graham bread, as
one chooses. For instance, a lettuce and
anchovy salad made by shredding the lettuce
and cutting the anchovies in two and dressing
with lemon juice and a dash of cayenne, with
the yolks of hard-boiled eggs finely minced,
seems to call for just such a tiny bit of toast
as one gets in this way of serving, to carry out
one&rsquo;s idea of perfection in little things.</p>

<div class="sidenote">French
Sandwiches</div>

<p>And after I had decided that the salads at
Hortensia&rsquo;s garden party should be so served,
it was quite natural that the idea of sandwiches
should suggest itself to my mind; but before
the idea had time to really assume a definite
shape I hastily but conclusively rebelled
against the prospect of seeing those time-honored
edibles set forth for the delectation
of Hortensia&rsquo;s guests in the guise of the common
or restaurant variety. And this is the
way I overcame what bade fair to be a troublesome
difficulty: Rolls, deliciously fresh French
rolls, with a circular piece of the top crust
removed and kept whole, while all the soft
part of the roll was scooped out to make
room for a filling of chicken, lobster, or sardines,
after which the little cover was put back
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>114]</a></span>
into place, and the comfort and joy of the
partaker was an assured thing.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Musk Melon
Jelly</div>

<p>After the sandwich scheme was fully arranged,
it seemed as though the &ldquo;substantials&rdquo;
were well looked out for, and that I must
be giving a thought to the fruits which were to
make glad the senses of those bidden to the
feast. Not any great amount of deep thinking
was required to make a selection, however,
for there was an abundance at hand from which
to choose; there were plums, juicy and sweet,
of richest hues&mdash;purple, red, and green,
and others of the most tempting golden color
imaginable, and certainly no well-furnished
table could afford to be without either specimen.
Grapes, too, there were in an infinite
variety, but for Hortensia&rsquo;s party I chose only
black Hamburgs and Muscats. Of course, I
knew she must have peaches, and I spent a
weary hour in trying to find some that tasted
as well as they looked, but my labor was in
vain. As a compensation for this disappointment,
however, I found cantaloupes possessing
a flavor which can only be expressed by the
words &ldquo;divinely perfect.&rdquo; And I found, too,
delicious little musk melons to be prepared in
this way: Slice the melon, removing both
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>115]</a></span>
rind and seeds, put in a preserving pan with a
little sugar, and stew to a marmalade; rub it
through a sieve, dissolve in it a sufficient
amount of gelatine, and when quite cool mix
with it stiffly whipped cream, flavored with
a little essence or liqueur, as one likes.</p>

<p>Cakes and ices, of course, are as important
to the great and unqualified success of a garden
party as are the guests, and of the former
I decided that the varieties known as &ldquo;Madeleines&rdquo;
and &ldquo;petits fours&rdquo; would be most
acceptable to all concerned, while of the latter
there could be no question as to the desirability
of mouss&eacute; with peaches, chocolat parfait, and
milk sherbet.</p>

<p>Of quite as much importance as either of
the articles mentioned in the foregoing paragraph
are the bonbons, and the advice which
I have bestowed upon Hortensia in regard to
them I repeat here for the benefit of any who
may care to follow it, namely: &ldquo;Costly thy
bonbons as thy purse can buy.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="sidenote">Moss Rose</div>

<p>For out-of-door feasting plenty of drinks
should be provided; &ldquo;cups,&rdquo; whether of claret,
hock, or champagne, should be made on the
spot and not prepared beforehand, as the taste
of stale soda water is absolutely objectionable.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>116]</a></span>
Cider, if iced, is really delicious, while a drink
which the English find highly refreshing is
called &ldquo;moss rose,&rdquo; and is made of equal
quantities of tea, coffee, and &ldquo;cup,&rdquo; either of
the champagne or claret brand.</p>

<hr class="break" />

<p>I have a story to tell you. It has nothing
of mystery in it, neither need it, necessarily,
prove harrowing; it is far from being romantic,
and there isn&rsquo;t a glimmer of sentiment in
it. It hasn&rsquo;t a moral; if it had I shouldn&rsquo;t
relate it. No, it is just true; that&rsquo;s the best
of it and it&rsquo;s the worst of it, too, as you will
admit, because it isn&rsquo;t without a parallel.</p>

<p>It&mdash;my story&mdash;is of a very charming old
farmhouse situated &ldquo;near to Nature&rsquo;s heart.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At this farmhouse was gathered together a
small company of people known to the natives
of that section of the country as &ldquo;summer
boarders.&rdquo; To themselves this same company
was known as a band of &ldquo;nature-worshippers.&rdquo;
One day they were all seated in the shade on
a little knoll, each one trying to outdo the
others in the matter of rhapsodizing the &ldquo;eternal
hills,&rdquo; the &ldquo;books to be found in brooks,&rdquo;
etc., when up spake one of their number who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>117]</a></span>
had hitherto been silent: &ldquo;Oh, I would give
all the delights that this place possesses for
one hour in the company of an ice-chest
stocked as it could be with the good things in
market now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Of course this was philistinism of the rankest
sort, and it savored of treason, too. But
the offender held her head high and parried
well, if the truth must be told, the rebukes of
her hearers. The mischief was done, however;
the seeds of discontent fell upon fertile
ground, made receptive by a long diet of
corned beef, curd cheese and &ldquo;plenty of milk.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The next morning every conveyance the
farmer-landlord could muster was pressed into
service to take his guests to the station.
Every one of them had received a sudden call
to Boston. But none confided to his or her
neighbor the exact nature of this post haste
summons to the Hub, and when the train
pulled into the station they scattered in different
directions, hurriedly saying to each other:
&ldquo;See you on the 4.30 train this afternoon;
good-by.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And sure enough they were all aboard
the train as agreed, each of them with an armful
of bundles. Nobody volunteered any
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>118]</a></span>
information as to what his or her bundles contained,
and nobody asked any questions.
They simply ignored the existence of them
and talked of how good it would seem to get
back to Peaceful Valley once more, with its
quietness and vast opportunities for reflection.</p>

<p>That night each of them had a private
audience with the landlady and the next
day at dinner was seen the result of the trip
to Boston and of the said private audience.</p>

<p>First of all was brought in some delicious
Spanish mackerel, broiled to a turn. These
were furnished by Professor A., author of the
celebrated work &ldquo;Does Angling Produce
Insanity?&rdquo; He said that of all the fish in
market these seemed to him just now the
most desirable.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Oyster Plant
with Cream</div>

<p>With the fish were served some of the finest
oyster plants that ever found their way into
the Boston market. They were cut in pieces,
boiled in salted water till tender, then drained
and served with a tablespoonful or so of melted
butter and cream enough to cover them,
having just a dash of pepper in it. A simple
way of preparing them and yet quite good
enough for anybody, as you will see upon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>119]</a></span>
trying it. My word for it, the Peaceful Valley
boarders thought it a dish fit for the gods.</p>

<p>After the mackerel had been discussed and
despatched and Professor A. had accepted
with a great deal of grace the vote of thanks
presented to him, the game was brought in.
This course was offered for the delectation of
his fellow-boarders by Professor B., author of
&ldquo;Birds I Have Met.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There were delicious chicken grouse that
had cost the professor quite a pretty penny,
viz.: two dollars and a half the pair; and
plover of various kinds that were to be had
for four dollars the dozen.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Grouse
Pie</div>

<p>And this is the way the grouse were cooked:
After the feet, necks, and pinions had been removed
their bodies were divided into three
pieces and put in a stewpan with the pinions
and a little chopped bacon; after frying a bit
some salt and pepper were introduced. Then
were added two tablespoonfuls of white wine
for each bird; then the birds were taken off
and cooled; after which they were arranged
with the wine in a pie dish with hard-boiled
eggs cut in quarters amongst them, covered
with the best pastry crust that the landlady
knew how to make, and it was pretty good,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>120]</a></span>
really. In fact the dish turned out a great
success, as the result of a good many conferences
between the donator of the birds and
the cook. The Professor had bought, the
day before, the latest and best thing in the
way of a cookery book, and after carefully
reading it had come to the conclusion that
this recipe for cooking grouse would be more
easily mastered by the landlady than any
other. The beauty of a grouse pie, too, as
everybody knows, lies in its being just as good
cold as it is hot.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Roasted
Plover</div>

<p>The plovers were dressed, and with a pinch
of salt and a bit of pepper put inside of them
and the thinnest possible slice of fat salt pork
tied over their breasts, were roasted for about
twelve minutes in a hot oven.</p>

<p>And with the game was served some of the
choicest stalks of celery that it has ever been
the lot of mortal to enjoy at this time of
year.</p>

<p>As for the fruit that was donated for this
special occasion you would consider it a treat
to hear the landlady tell of it, and of the sensations
she experienced at seeing such a variety
when the &ldquo;apples on the Early Harvest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>121]</a></span>
tree on the south side of the orchard wall
were only just beginning to get mellow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There were plums of almost every color
under the sun; there were nectarines, the
mere sight of which would make one&rsquo;s mouth
to water; there were delicious Delaware grapes
and some little white grapes called the Lady
de Coverley, that come from California. They
are just as good, too, as one would expect
from the name that has been given them.
There was a curiosity in the shape of a banana
cantaloupe, and there were all sorts of other
melons, but the melon <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">par excellence</i> was
what is known as the Montreal cantaloupe.
They are raised on the banks of the St. Lawrence
River, and simply refuse to grow in any
other locality. Gardeners in other places have
done everything to induce it to become naturalized,
but all to no purpose. The particular
specimen that found its way to the Peaceful Valley
weighed just twenty-one pounds, and cost
the purchaser $2.50. But it wasn&rsquo;t extravagance
to buy twenty-one pounds of such
deliciousness, even if it had cost twice that
sum.</p>

<p>And what do you suppose these nature-worshippers
did after partaking of all the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>122]</a></span>
good things herein described and set forth?
Well, they went out and sat under the trees
and began to talk of what Thoreau said about
huckleberries!</p>

<p>I came away then.</p>

<hr class="break" />

<p>As a refreshing <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">entr&rsquo;acte</i> let us dwell on the
subject of ices. Let us have something more
than just the ordinary way of making every-day
routine ice creams. We will say &ldquo;ices&rdquo;&mdash;they
mean unutterable, indescribable things
that tickle the palate and cool one&rsquo;s very
existence simultaneously. Though after all
it may be well to talk a minute of ice creams&mdash;beginning
with generalities. The first of these
I have found is that the easiest and best ice
cream is made by using one-third rich cream
to two-thirds milk with sugar as desired.
No eggs and no cooking. If it is frozen
smoothly it is perfect. This, however, is but
the working plan&mdash;the flavoring and the
moulding are to be arranged to suit yourself.</p>

<p>However, if cream is not available, then
eggs and milk in the proportion of eight eggs
to one quart of milk may be used. This
requires cooking like an ordinary custard.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>123]</a></span>
Sugar to your taste, but flour or cornstarch
are to be left out, by all means.</p>

<p>If you are using fresh fruits, such as pineapple,
peaches, strawberries and the like they
should not be cooked but be added to the cream
after it is frozen and just before it is packed.
Candied fruit, fruit used for frozen puddings
and the like, is usually soaked in brandy or
rum before adding to the cream. At least,
that&rsquo;s the sort of treatment it gets from me.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Coffee
Ice Cream</div>

<p>Just a word about coffee ice cream. For
I don&rsquo;t think you will find this recipe anywhere
else. And it&rsquo;s a pity you shouldn&rsquo;t
know of it. Have then one pint of very
strong coffee, a gill of brandy, one quart of
cream and three pints of rich milk. Then
freeze and be thankful whenever a hot day
makes it possible for you to serve your coffee
at dinner in this way.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Milk Sherbet</div>

<p>A great many people have a preference for
sherbets and of these I have some charming
things to say, for I appreciate a sherbet
myself. There&rsquo;s a milk sherbet that suits
me down to the ground. It is made of two
quarts of milk, four cups of sugar, and the
juice of six lemons. Also the whites whipped
well of two or three or more eggs as you feel
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>124]</a></span>
inclined to use them. Surely the lemons will
curdle the milk. But don&rsquo;t let that disturb
you. Put it in the freezer and go ahead. It
will come out as right as right can be.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Strawberry
Sherbet</div>

<p>For a strawberry sherbet made in this way
I have a fondness that I am not ashamed to
acknowledge anywhere: Sprinkle over one
quart of strawberries half a pound of sugar;
let it stand three hours, then strain through a
coarse cloth, squeezing hard. To this juice
add three pints of water, as much sugar as it
seems to you to need, the juice of a lemon
and freeze.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Pineapple
Sherbet</div>

<p>A pineapple sherbet is made in the same
way, though not as much sugar will be required
probably.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Peach
Sherbet</div>

<p>And for a peach sherbet follow the same
directions, adding a wineglassful of brandy
before freezing.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Currant
Sherbet</div>

<p>A currant sherbet is a deliciously refreshing
thing to have either in anticipation
or in reality on a hot day. Boil a quart
of water and a pound of sugar to a
syrup. Skim and stir with it a pint of fresh
currant juice which has been heated with a
little sugar. Let this cool thoroughly, then
add the beaten whites of four eggs and freeze.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>125]</a></span>
For myself, I am quite through shying when
anyone says artificial coloring in food&mdash;I
have found the vegetable colorings as innocuous
as so much water, and worth their weight
in gold in cases like the present, namely the
coloring of this currant sherbet. The only
drawback about which is that of itself it will
not be pretty to the eye&mdash;therefore hesitate
not, but in with a few drops of carmine coloring.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Champagne
Sherbet</div>

<p>A champagne ice isn&rsquo;t such a high-roller
refreshment as it sounds. To begin with it&rsquo;s
a rank solecism to freeze any but the most
inexpensive of champagnes, and then you
don&rsquo;t require many other good things for
your ice&mdash;the champagne is enough in itself.
You just make a very strong and sweet lemonade&mdash;a
quart of it and half freeze it; then
pour in the champagne and wholly freeze the
mixture. Get the champagne into the freezer
as soon as you can after it is opened before
its volatile gas escapes. If you prefer a more
hilarious refreshment just keep on with your
use of intoxicants by adding after the champagne
a wineglassful of brandy. Also, if you
like, you may add the beaten whites of eggs,

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>126]</a></span>
While we are on the subject of frozen
champagne and the entering wedge has done
its work let me speak a good word for champagne
with strawberries. Freeze together a
quart of champagne and a pint of sugar syrup.
Just at the last add one pint of strawberries
which have been halved and quartered and
marinaded in a little brandy and sugar for
about fifteen minutes. Cherries used in this
way will make you ready to declare that till
you tried it you didn&rsquo;t know how to live.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Claret
Sherbet</div>

<p>A claret sherbet is even better than it
sounds if you make it in this way: Rub the
peel of two oranges off with plenty of loaf
sugar and then make a syrup of this sugar
and a pint of water. When cool, stir in the
juice of three oranges, a quart of claret, a
tablespoonful of brandy and the whites of four
eggs whipped to a stiff froth and freeze slowly.
Sometimes there is used in this recipe the
zest of lemon peel instead of oranges and then
there is used some orange marmalade, heated
and strained of course. Or any jelly which
you may fancy goes in very harmoniously
with this concoction.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Kirsch
Sherbet</div>

<p>A kirsch sherbet is a delicacy that doesn&rsquo;t
put itself in the way of ordinary mortals every
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>127]</a></span>
day in the week. That&rsquo;s why its welcome is
a soulful one when it does appear. You have
a pint of chablis and a pint of any preferred
fruit syrup, which you freeze. Then at the
last there is added to it half a pint of kirschenwasser.</p>

<p>By the way, before I forget it, you may
treat watermelon with the frozen champagne
exactly as prescribed hereinbefore for
strawberries and champagne.</p>

<p>All these are but a few of the ices familiar
to expert cooks nowadays. But each one
herein given is capable of so many variations
that I am leaving that part of it to you. Do
you know that I am saddened more and more
every day as I contemplate the power that
lies in suggestion and the stupidity of people
who will not avail themselves of it? But
this is not perhaps the sort of talk you look
for in a book that has to do with the material
things of life. Very well, we will cut it off.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">A</span>BOUT the only time when I am really
anxious to have the right to vote is
when some legislation tending toward
the preservation of the lobster is on the
docket. Then, if I had the opportunity, I
should not only vote with both hands for a
&ldquo;close season&rdquo; on that delectable shellfish,
but I should lecture as long as I could get any
one to listen to me, either on Boston Common
or in Faneuil Hall, in an endeavor to
induce others, men and women, to vote with
me. I believe I should even resort to bribery
where I thought it would do&mdash;and I am a

their &ldquo;inducements&rdquo; to be too heavily coated
with sugar&mdash;in order to put it through.</p>

<p>As matters are now there are almost as
many ways for preparing lobster as there are
lobsters in the sea, and in order to try them
all you would better be about it before the

Lobster</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>129]</a></span>
For devilling lobsters I have a budget of
recipes, but this seems to be about the best
one in the lot: Split the lobster, after it is
boiled, in two lengthwise, and put it into a
baking-pan; season with salt and cayenne, and
pour over it plenty of melted butter, and bake
in a hot oven for five minutes. Just before
serving spread over it a sauce of melted butter
thickened with flour and seasoned with a few
drops of lemon juice, a sprinkling of mustard,
and a little Madeira or sherry wine.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Lobster
Toast</div>

<p>Lest you should get so attached to this
devilled lobster of mine, I hasten to put here
an alluring sounding recipe, hoping you may
be induced to try it before forming the devilled
lobster habit. First fry a sliced onion in
enough butter so that there will be no browning
of it. Take out the onion in two or
three minutes, as it is only intended to flavor
the butter, and then fry in this butter the
diced meat of two boiled lobsters for two
or three minutes. Sprinkle in some chopped
parsley and salt and pepper as you like it.
Pour over the lobster a pint of white wine,
and as soon as this gets to the boiling point
take out the lobster and put it on slices of
toast. Into the boiling wine put all the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>130]</a></span>
butter from the lobsters, just a few chopped
mushrooms, if they are at hand, and pour
over the slices of lobster toast. Have this
just as hot as possible when sending to table,
and you will find the alluringness of this dish
is not in the telling of it only.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Lobster
Tartlet</div>

<p>A lobster tartlet is a gastronomical dream,
let me tell you, while we are on the subject,
and after you try it you will be telling the
same story. You should have tartlet moulds
made of the very best puff paste, which you
fill with diced cold boiled lobster, chopped
cooked mushrooms, a caper or two, and a bit
of mayonnaise.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Lobster <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">&agrave; la</span>
Newberg</div>

<p>Lobster <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">&agrave; la</i> Newberg is such a staple dish
that it seems almost like plagiarizing something
or somebody to put it on record here. However,
as no list of lobster dishes is correct
without it, here it shall go. Cut the boiled
lobster into two-inch pieces and fry over a
tremendously hot fire, either in a chafing dish or
on a range, for just two or three seconds; lessen
the heat then, or pull the frying-pan into
cooler quarters, while you cover the lobster
with thick, rich cream. Let this come to a
threat to boil, then stir in say three egg yolks
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>131]</a></span>
to a pint of cream, the yolks stirred in a little
cream, till it thickens a bit. Just a dash of
sherry, say two tablespoonfuls, and there
you are.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Stuffed
Lobster Tails</div>

<p>For stuffing lobster tails cut the meat of
the lobsters up rather finely, and add to it
half its quantity of mushrooms. Fry in butter
a bit, dilute with a little cream, season
highly with cayenne and salt and fill the half
tails with the mixture. Coat with bread
crumbs that have been stirred about in melted
butter, and brown in a hot oven.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Lobster
Croquettes</div>

<p>The making of lobster croquettes is a pleasant
sort of business, for there is so much anticipation
of good to come stirred in with it.
Cut the meat&mdash;don&rsquo;t chop it&mdash;rather finely:
moisten with a bit of cream and the butter
from the lobster. Mould and roll in crumbs
and fry a golden brown. Don&rsquo;t go to seasoning
these croquettes very highly or the delicacy
will depart from them. But you know that.
And do you know that you may add to almost
any sauce used for boiled or baked fish some
diced cooked lobster to the benefit of everything
and everybody concerned? Well, you
may&mdash;my word for it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>132]</a></span>
If I were to tack a sub-title to this screed
it might very properly be: &ldquo;Women&rsquo;s Luncheons,&rdquo;
inasmuch as it was in aid of one of
these mild social dissipations that I last perambulated
through the markets. Very properly
also I might characterize the trip as a &ldquo;peripatetic
wandering through the market-place,&rdquo;
for all the while I was in quest of edibles
suitable to put before a purely feminine company
I was talking to myself about the probable
origin of this form of hospitality. When,
where, and by whom it was invented? My
own conjecture as to its inception finally took
this course: Algernon was in the habit of
attending a great many goings-on to which
women were never bidden. And Araminta
frequently discussed with him the calls thus
made upon his time. Whereupon it came to
pass that after one particularly interesting debate
on the subject, which debate was brought
to an end by the sharp, quick closing of the
street door, Araminta had an idea. An idea
which she called an inspiration, nothing less,
and it had for its starting-point a luncheon, a
dainty, gay little affair, at which no black coat
should be allowed to intrude. And the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pi&egrave;ce
de r&eacute;sistance</i> of the meal should be a sweet
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>133]</a></span>
called &ldquo;revenge.&rdquo; Oh, yes indeed, not only
would her guests applaud her originality, but
the hearts of the absent males would be torn
to tatters at her assumption of independence.
And doubtless Part One of the programme was
carried out to the letter, but, between you and
me, I don&rsquo;t believe Algernon ever lost a wink
of sleep over it. In fact, when he settled the
bill I have good reasons for mistrusting that
he said something about the &ldquo;game being
jolly well worth the candle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But to-day the women&rsquo;s luncheon is an institution,
and a very chic and dainty diversion
into the bargain. And there are those who
make it their business to tell how a woman
should be arrayed at such a festivity, but that
is out of my province. If, however, you
would know how the menu should read at
this time of year, allow me:&mdash;</p>

<p class="menu">
Cantaloupe.<br />
Bouillon in cups.<br />

<span class="mpadright1">Lamb cutlets with mushrooms.</span><br />

Wine ice cream.<span class="mspace2">&nbsp;</span>Grapes.<span class="mspace2">&nbsp;</span>Coffee.</p>

<p>I almost said oysters at the beginning of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>134]</a></span>
the menu, but oysters we shall have with us
for several months to come, while cantaloupes
are beginning to say it&rsquo;s about time they were
going. As yet, however, they are just as delicious
and no more expensive than they have
been at any time through the season.</p>

<p>Now as for bouillon. I get it canned, and
think myself very fortunate in being able to
do so. But you may prefer to make your
own, and if so you probably have an always
reliable recipe. <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mes congratulations.</i></p>

<div class="sidenote">Lobster
Patties</div>

<p>But if you have a score of recipes for
making lobster patties, I honestly believe you
will follow the one I am pleased to give you
herein. I take myself very seriously, you
see. Well, prepare some of the very best puff
paste that you know how to make. Roll it
out on a floured table; with a fluted cutter
cut out some rounds, put them on a baking
dish, set them on ice for fifteen minutes, then
brush them over with beaten egg. With a
plain tin cutter of about half the size of the
fluted cover cut through a third of each of
the rounds, dipping the cutter in warm water
every time; this will form the cover when
baked. Bake in a quick oven. When cooked
lift off the cover and scoop out a little of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>135]</a></span>
soft paste inside. For the lobster filling take
the meat from a boiled lobster, cut it into very
small pieces and fry a little in butter, in a
very little butter, till they just threaten to
brown. Then pour over the lobster bits
enough thick cream to barely cover them;
heat this, but don&rsquo;t let it boil. Thicken it
with two or more beaten eggs, according to
the quantity of lobster. Season delicately
with salt and a suspicion of cayenne. Have
the patties hot and the lobster hot, and arrange
them on a hot dish for serving. For dear
knows that a cold or a lukewarm patty is an
abomination.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Lamb Cutlets
with
Mushrooms</div>

<p>After the patties the lamb cutlets. And,
mind you, they are to be fried, not broiled.
Season them well with salt and pepper, and
fry in a little butter over a brisk fire till
browned on both sides. Then drain off the
butter and baste them with just a little Madeira
wine. Dress the cutlets in a circle and
pour into the centre a Madeira sauce with
mushrooms. This you make by heating half
a pint of any good stock, adding to it a gill of
Madeira, thickening it with a little flour braided
with butter, and adding at the last a dozen
mushrooms that have been minced and fried
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>136]</a></span>
moderately in a little butter. You may use
sherry instead of the Madeira for basting the
cutlets and for the sauce if you like. And
also you may use the tinned instead of fresh
mushrooms if you prefer to do so. For fresh
mushrooms may not be any too plenty just
now, and consequently are a thought expensive.
Still, they&rsquo;re quite worth the price.</p>

<p>And now that the &ldquo;law&rsquo;s off&rdquo; probably
hereabouts on quail, you will find them in
pretty good condition. Indeed, they are so
good that I hope you will just have them
broiled after salting a bit, and pin your faith
to their own delicious flavor to give delight
to your guests. Have them served on toast,
if you must, that has been slightly buttered,
but forget to serve any jelly with them.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve told you elsewhere all about tomatoes
stuffed with celery and mayonnaise, so I won&rsquo;t
go into particulars this time. But tomatoes
will not be with us at the prices for which we
can now get them a great while longer, and
celery is remarkably good in quality and low
in price. So there&rsquo;s a good broad hint for you.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Wine
Ice Cream</div>

<p>That wine ice cream which I have recommended
is truly a delightful confection. You
have a pint of moderately rich cream, and you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>137]</a></span>
add to it the yolks of five eggs and three
tablespoonfuls of sugar, and then you heat it
just a trifle. Next you stir in a gill of white
wine, and then you freeze it. When quite
frozen stir into it some chopped preserved
cherries. Then turn the cream into a mould
packed in ice to set till time for serving, when
it is to be turned out on a cold dish. Doesn&rsquo;t
that sound as if it would be worth a trial?</p>

<p>You see I&rsquo;ve simply said grapes in the
menu because, as far as that fruit is concerned
just now, it is a case of paying your money
and taking your choice.</p>

<p>And what will the ladies have to drink?
Suppose we say a sip of sherry with the bouillon
and a bottle of pretty good Rhine wine to
be brought in with the cutlets. And it
doesn&rsquo;t seem to me that it would be overdoing
the matter to have a cordial finale&mdash;say
cr&egrave;me yvette, or cr&egrave;me de cacao &agrave; la vanille.</p>

<p>Of course, I will tell you the approximate
cost of such a luncheon. With good management
it can be served, inclusive of the
wines, for twelve dollars for a dozen persons.
And that is not bad, now, is it?</p>

<p>Didn&rsquo;t you just enjoy that cooling little
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">entr&rsquo;acte</i> we had in July? I did. Let&rsquo;s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>138]</a></span>
have another. We will not have anything
sweet in this, however, we will have it cold
and savory. Doesn&rsquo;t that hit you favorably?
There are plenty of cold and dainty savories
that may come to table as your chief dish at
luncheon or at dinner or as an entr&eacute;e only, at
the latter meal, according to the degree with
which you manage to put on style.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Cold Chicken
Cream</div>

<p>There&rsquo;s chicken cream, for instance, made
from a cold boiled or roasted&mdash;well, bird.
I don&rsquo;t know whether it&rsquo;s chicken or fowl.
Perhaps you paid for chicken and got fowl.
Perhaps you paid for fowl and wheedled the
provisioner into giving you chicken. But
we will say chicken, anyway. Pick, then, all
the flesh from the chicken, mince and then
pound it. Now add to it half a pint of cream
stiffly whipped and half a pint of just liquid
aspic jelly. Season with salt and white pepper
and any other condiment if you like. Then
have one large or several small moulds and
line them with aspic jelly and fill with the
chicken cream. Let set till cold and stiff and
then unmould on slices of very thin fried bread.
Chop parsley and sprinkle over the creams
when unmoulded.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Chicken
Cream
with Tomato</div>

<p>Another way would be to line the moulds
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>139]</a></span>
with liquid aspic and a little tomato sauce.
When this sets fill with the chicken cream as
before. If you like the cream may be
omitted from the chicken and when it is
unmoulded it may be covered with a French
dressing or with mayonnaise.</p>

<p>Any remains of cold meat can be chopped
finely, mixed with shredded lettuce or watercress
or parsley, capers, stoned olives, a truffle
or two and mayonnaise, with enough liquid
aspic to stiffen it and moulded in any way.</p>

<p>These do make delicious presentations of
old subjects&mdash;just a little labor and a little
inventive painstaking and you have accomplished
wonders. There are so many garnishes
that may be used with these cold things
to make them more of a delight that it is
impossible to go through the list. Sliced
tomatoes or cucumbers or some cold cooked
vegetable with a French dressing&mdash;any quantity
of them you see once you begin to cast
about for them.</p>

<p>No one knows better than I do that to
make the conventional aspic jelly is a labor
that involves terrible risks as regards the
breaking of the commandment concerning
profanity. I don&rsquo;t mind telling you that I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>140]</a></span>
found it was having such a degenerating effect
on my whole moral nature that I hit upon
using just the best gelatine I can buy&mdash;this
is not the place to name it, however&mdash;and
dissolving it in a clear stock&mdash;white or brown
as the case demands. Try it in making these
aspic things.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Cold Cutlets
in Jelly</div>

<p>You know, of course, that cold cutlets are
the most impossible left-over thing with which
the housekeeper has to deal. But prepare
some savory jelly with stock and tomato
sauce and coat these left-over cutlets with it
some day and have them for luncheon. You
will confess that you have learned something
worth knowing.</p>

<p>Then there are numberless kinds of fish,
almost any kind in fact that doesn&rsquo;t run to
bone, that will flake well; dip the pieces in
a jelly of this kind diluted with any kind of
sauce&mdash;Hollandaise, vinaigrette, tomato, and
so on to the end of the list. Now, mind,
when I say coat these viands with this jelly
I don&rsquo;t mean for you to give them a regular
ulster for a coat&mdash;but a little thin diaphanous
jacket, suitable for hot weather, you understand.</p>

<p>When you can use cream in the jellies,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>141]</a></span>
either whipped or straight, the daintiness of
them is increased by just so much.</p>

<p>There are some kinds of game&mdash;dark game
especially&mdash;that you may slice and coat with
this jelly using currant jelly with it also and
get some combinations that will drive your
friends to despair.</p>

<p>Bear in mind that these jellied things must
be kept on ice till served and the plates on
which they are served must also be ice-cold.
It does seem too bad for me to have to burden
my soul with such instructions for you&mdash;they
should be needless. But when good
fortune takes me to luncheon in a crack hotel
and I get my salad on a hot plate, or a hot
plate set before me for the serving of it, I am
forced to the conclusion that the mental lightweights
are still in evidence and there&rsquo;s no
knowing but what some of them in a moment
of lucidity may become the owner of this
book. Therefore I go into tiresome details,
occasionally.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HERE are persons, as some of us
can testify, who appear to be horrified
if a Manhattan cocktail is mentioned
in the most casual manner, and who are warranted
to shy if they but get a whiff of a
Martini, but give them a chance to partake of
an oyster cocktail and you have added a substantial
item to their sum of worldly pleasure.</p>

<p>Almost everybody likes an oyster cocktail
when it is judiciously mixed, but folk of the
ilk above referred to do seem to have a peculiar
fondness for it. Now, is it because a
course of total abstinence has rendered their
palates extremely sensitive to highly seasoned
impressions, or is it that the name has a witchery
that beguiles them into thinking that they
are tasting a forbidden thing without sacrificing
a principle? I don&rsquo;t know. You tell.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Oyster
Cocktail</div>

<p>And tell me, too, if this is the way you set
about preparing one of these palate-ticklers.
Half a dozen little oysters dropped into a
glass, with their juice, a little lemon juice, four
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>143]</a></span>
miserly drops of Tabasco sauce, half a teaspoonful
of Worcestershire sauce, a dessertspoonful
of tomato ketchup, and several
grains of salt. Or do you substitute horse-radish
for the Tabasco? They tell me it&rsquo;s
frequently done, but for myself I prefer the
Tabasco. It is a vexed question, anyway,
this matter of what shall be put on a raw
oyster to make it more palatable; the real
dyed-in-the-wool epicurean vows that it is
nothing short of barbarism to use more than
the tiniest pinch of salt, while many a discriminating
gourmet declares that the more you
do for an oyster the more it does for you.
So there you are.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Baked
Oysters</div>

<p>But epicureans and laymen alike are agreed
on one point, and that is the way to bake
oysters so that they are worthy of a place on
any table. Put into a small lined stewpan a
quarter of a pound of butter and one teacupful
of cream, stirring it well over a quick fire
till hot. Add a wineglass of sherry, a tablespoonful
of anchovy sauce, and a skimpy
sprinkling of cayenne and grated lemon peel.
Stir over the fire till it bubbles once. Then
pour half of the mixture into a baking dish.
Lay the oysters on it, besprinkle them with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>144]</a></span>
a scanty covering of bread-crumbs and grated
Parmesan cheese, with salt and pepper. Pour
the remainder of the cream over all and brown
to a good color.</p>

<p>Once one gets in the way of baking oysters
as herein prescribed, one&rsquo;s recipe for scalloped
oysters, no matter how true and tried, will be
lost sight of.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Oyster Stew
with Cream</div>

<p>And the same fate will likely befall one&rsquo;s
rule for making an oyster stew, provided one
adopts this suggestion for preparing oysters
with cream. In the first place there should
be put into a saucepan a pint of cream with a
tiny piece of onion and a little mace tied up
in a muslin bag. When the cream boils
thicken it with a tablespoonful of flour mixed
with two tablespoonfuls of cream. Heat a
quart of oysters, with their liquor and sufficient
salt. Then drain and put them into a
dish which is to be sent to table; pour the
cream over them, removing the onion and
mace. With the dish serve toasted bread or
biscuit.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Devilled
Fried Oysters</div>

<p>Undoubtedly all your friends are ready to
take oath that you do have at your table the
very best fried oysters they ever tasted.
But the next time that you regale them with the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>145]</a></span>
dish, let the oysters be devilled and then fried.
Wipe the oysters perfectly dry and lay them
on a flat dish. Have a goodly supply of
butter at just the melting point, mix with it a
little salt, a suspicion of cayenne, and a certainty
of lemon juice; pour this over the
oysters and leave them in it for at least
ten minutes. Then roll them in a paper of
cracker crumbs or sifted bread-crumbs; dip
them into beaten egg, then into the crumbs
again, and fry in boiling lard.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Stuffed
Fried Oysters</div>

<p>Or you can make a dish of fried oysters
even more elaborate if you will chop six ounces
of the white meat of any fowl with one ounce
of fat salt pork, pound it in a mortar till
your stock of patience threatens to strike,
then chop a few truffles to the size of peas,
and add them with a little white pepper to the
chopped meat. Have four dozen oysters
wiped dry, and with a sharp knife make an
opening in the side of each one; fill the holes
with the mixture. Dip the oysters in crumbs,
then in egg, again in the crumbs, and fry.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Oysters,
Celery Roast</div>

<p>Now see to it that your guests don&rsquo;t exhaust
their pet adjectives on either of these dishes.
They will need at least a good round dozen of
superlatives after an experience with a celery
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>146]</a></span>
roast of oysters. And this is the way the
story goes: Have ready some dainty slices of
bread, toasted, with the crusts removed.
Wipe dry and broil some of the smallest
oysters you can get; broil till they begin
to shrivel all round, then put them on
the toast. Sprinkle a little salt over them;
cover them with some finely chopped
celery. Salt the celery a bit also. Have
ready cream heated, but not boiled, and
pour it over the whole. Serve it as hot as
possible, and rejoice in the fact that you have
demonstrated how divine a thing an oyster
may be made.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Oyster Pie</div>

<p>It&rsquo;s a thousand pities that everybody
doesn&rsquo;t know how to make good puff paste,
for without that knowledge it is impossible to
make a good oyster pie; but in case you are an
adept at puff paste making, just try concocting
one some fine day. Line a pie dish with the
paste and fill it with uncooked rice; butter
the paste that covers the edge of the dish and
lay a cover of puff paste over the pie; press
the edges together a bit and trim them neatly.
Meanwhile prepare a quart of oysters by
draining them from their liquor and chopping
them fine. Mix a teaspoonful of cornstarch
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>147]</a></span>
in a very little cold milk, and pour over
slowly half a pint of boiling milk or cream;
when it is thick and smooth add to it an ounce
of butter. Season the oysters with salt and
pepper, and stir them into the mixture;
simmer for five minutes. When the pie-crust
is done remove it from the oven, take off the
top crust, turn out all the rice and fill the dish
with the oysters; put on the cover again, and
set in the oven to get thoroughly hot.</p>

<p>They do say the recollection of an oyster
pie so made is one of the sweetest echoes to
start when memory plays a tune on the heart,
even though one lives to be as old as Methuselah.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Pickled
Oysters</div>

<p>And now let me tell you of a way to prepare
oysters so that they may come under the
head of stand-bys, so dear to every housekeeper.
Take two quarts of oysters and put
them into a porcelain-lined saucepan with
their own liquor strained, half a grated nutmeg,
a teaspoonful of salt, a little cayenne,
and half a pint of strong vinegar. Then into
a muslin bag put half a teaspoonful of cloves,
two blades of mace, a teaspoonful of allspice,
and two bay leaves; put this in with the
oysters. Let them cook very slowly, stirring
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>148]</a></span>
all the while with a wooden spoon. As soon
as they come to a boil pour them into an
earthenware jar. When thoroughly cold they
are ready to serve; if they are well covered in
a cool place they can easily be kept for a
week or even longer.</p>

<hr class="break" />

<p>Of late years, when the subject of home-made
preserves and pickles has been referred
to in my hearing, I have been wont to assume
a very superior and quite top-lofty air, and to
remark in a know-it-all tone of voice: &ldquo;Oh,
life&rsquo;s too short for me to bother with anything
like that; give me the fruits and vegetables
and all other edibles that one can buy
preserved in tin or glass the year round;
they&rsquo;re better than home-made nine times out
of ten, they cost no more in the end, and
there&rsquo;s slight necessity for guesswork when
you are to open a can as to the condition of
its contents.&rdquo; Sometimes, if I had a very
tractable audience, this would end all discussion
for the time being. At others it would
fairly set the advocates of domestic preserving
by their ears, and then you may be sure they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>149]</a></span>
defended their cause in good earnest. But
they never induced me to go in for anything
of the sort. Still, I now have on hand a very
fair array of jars and bottles and tumblers
filled with jellies and jams and pickles, and
they are home-made, and they are old-fashioned
and I am proud of them. And
I&rsquo;ll tell you how it happened. Out in the
country, three weeks or so ago, I was passing
a farmhouse where the door opening into the
kitchen stood wide open, and through that
open door came a fragrant breath that called
to mind numberless sweet woodsy smells.
There was in it a suggestion of sweet fern, a
reminder of bayberry, a hint of sassafras and
a distinct likeness of grapevine blossoms.
And this divine odor was conjured up, I
learned, by the stewing of grapes&mdash;wild grapes,
of course; the cultivated varieties being quite
out of it when it comes to preserving. That
settled it. Within twenty-four hours from
that time there was issuing from my kitchen
an odor of wild grapes a-stewing.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Grape Jam</div>

<p>To go into particulars, I was making grape
jam. I weighed the grapes, and to every
pound I allowed three-quarters of a pound
of sugar. Then I squeezed the pulp out of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>150]</a></span>
the skins, putting the pulp in one bowl and
the skins in another. The sugar with a
quarter of its quantity of water was boiled
in a preserving kettle till it was quite clear.
Then was added to it the pulp of the grapes
which were boiled ever so slowly for twenty
minutes&mdash;when they were rubbed through a
hair sieve and put back on the stove, with
the skins added to them. Then they
were boiled until the skins filled and looked
good and plump. And when they were quite
cooled I put them into jars covered tightly
to keep out the air. Next winter I shall depend
upon this jam to help me out at many
a luncheon with hot buttered toast or with
waffles. And I&rsquo;ve a strong notion that it
won&rsquo;t play me false.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Quince
Marmalade</div>

<p>You know how one word leads to another.
Well, I find that one preserve leads to another
just as surely. After making the grape
jam I was determined to try my hand at
quinces&mdash;at quince marmalade. And it turned
out such a success that I offer the recipe for
your use if you like to try it. Peel and cut
into thin slices four pounds of quinces, put
them into a preserving kettle, with half their
quantity of peeled and sliced sweet apples,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>151]</a></span>
two quarts of water and the juice of a lemon.
Cover the kettle and let the contents boil
quickly till softened; then put in three pounds
of crushed sugar loaf, and stir over the fire
while it boils slowly for twenty minutes. Take
the kettle from the fire, pour the marmalade
into jars, and when it is cool tie brandied
papers over the tops. I shall find many uses
for this sweet, I fancy, and some day when I
am quite put to it to know what to have for
dessert, I shall just have the simplest sort of
a bread pudding, and for a sauce some of this
quince marmalade.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Quince Jelly</div>

<p>And having made the marmalade, I find
that no reasonable excuse exists for not making
quince jelly, because the parings can be
used along with more of the fruit. Core the
whole fruit and put this with the parings into
a stewpan with just as much water as will
cover them; stew them gently till they are
tender, but not red. Strain the juice from
the quinces without pressing them, measure it,
and for each cupful allow an equal quantity
of crushed loaf sugar. Pour the juice into a
preserving pan and boil it for twenty minutes,
then add the sugar and boil until reduced to
the consistency of jelly, stirring it well all the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>152]</a></span>
time. Strain through a jelly bag and pour
into small jelly tumblers. And this you know
is going to be not only a toothsome bit, but
if I put it into a pretty and suitable dish and
set it in just the right place on my luncheon
or dinner table, it will be a thing of beauty.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Plum Jam</div>

<p>I&rsquo;m feeling rather proud, too, of my success
with plum jam. It really strikes me as
being delicious, and from the favored few who
have been allowed to &ldquo;taste&rdquo; it, I have heard
very flattering things. So you shall receive this
recipe also. Have ready say twelve pounds
of large ripe plums peeled and divided into
halves; crack their stones, blanch the kernels
and pound them in a mortar. Put the parings
and cracked stones into a pan with three
quarts of water. Boil this until it is reduced
one-half, and then strain it through a fine
wire sieve. Put the fruit into a preserving
pan with the strained liquor and pounded
kernels and twelve pounds of crushed loaf
sugar. Cook over a slow fire until it is reduced
to a stiff jam, then turn it into jars
and let it stand till quite cold, sift into
each jar a layer of powdered sugar, cover with
rounds of paper dipped in brandy, tie securely
and put away. Some foggy morning spread
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>153]</a></span>
a little of this jam on some toasted muffins
for breakfast, have some English breakfast
tea, and play you are in &ldquo;Lunnun.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="sidenote">Brandied
Plums</div>

<p>Really, you know, I shouldn&rsquo;t feel that I
had done the right thing by you if, after
recommending that jams be covered by brandied
papers I should omit to say something
of plums preserved in brandy. They make
a dainty tidbit, serve them when you will&mdash;morning,
noon, or night. You don&rsquo;t want to
use plums that are any more than ripe; in
fact, if they&rsquo;re not much more than half-ripe
it will be quite as well. Say you have eight
pounds of them; prick them all over and put
over the fire in cold water. As soon as the
water boils and the fruit rises to the surface
take out with a skimmer and lay them in a
pan of ice water. Then make a clear syrup
of two pounds of loaf sugar and a pint of
water. Put in the plums and let them
boil up just once; and let them stand
in the syrup over night. The next day
take them out of the syrup, boil this
once, put in the plums and let them
boil just once and let them stand over night
once more in the syrup. Repeat this operation
the next day and the following day, then
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>154]</a></span>
drain the plums and put them into bottles.
Boil the syrup till it will almost candy, and
when quite cold add to it three-fourths of
its own quantity of the best brandy you feel
that you can afford, mix thoroughly with the
syrup, strain it and pour over the plums.
Cork the bottles securely.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Brandied
Peaches</div>

<p>But if it&rsquo;s peaches that you want to see in
brandy, you go about it in this way: Split
the peaches in halves and boil them in a
syrup such as is used for the plums. Boil
them two minutes only, then take them out
and remove their skins, put them back in the
syrup to simmer for five minutes; take
the pan off and leave the peaches in it till the
next day. Then drain and arrange them
carefully in jars. Boil the syrup down
and mix with it an equal quantity of white
brandy and when quite cold pour it over the
peaches. Cover the jars tightly. And it&rsquo;s
not for me to tell you when to use them,&mdash;because
the using of brandied peaches soon
becomes a fixed habit, and it&rsquo;s pretty hard to
be able to tell when not to use them.</p>

<hr class="break" />

<div class="sidenote">Apples in
Vanilla
Syrup</div>

<p>Why is it that housekeepers, the land over,
with excellent reputations as &ldquo;good
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>155]</a></span>
managers,&rdquo; see in an apple only three possibilities,
to wit: apple pie, apple sauce and baked
apples, when by the aid of a vegetable spoon,
such as is used for preparing Parisienne
potatoes, the apples may be scooped out into
balls, cooked in a syrup flavored with vanilla,
served hot with a sprinkling of finely chopped
pistachios over all, and so served be worthy a
place on the table of the veriest gourmet?
Hardly a whit more trouble involved, you
see, or expense, for that matter, than in the
preparation of &ldquo;apple sauce,&rdquo; and yet how
much more appetizing and wholly satisfactory!
Again, if you want to idealize baked apples,
have them peeled and cored, then boil in a
flavored syrup till tender, but firm, and with
sugar and burnt almond scattered over them
set in oven to acquire a delicate brown.
Garnish when serving with bits of marmalade
or jelly.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Fried Apples</div>

<p>The frying of apples successfully is a ticklish
matter, it must be admitted, but if the
fruit is perfectly sound when peeled, cored,
and quartered, the fat piping hot, with only a
few pieces dropped in at a time, if, as I say,
all these conditions prevail and your fried
apples be not a success, then rest assured
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>156]</a></span>
there is some witchcraft at work and you are
in no wise to blame. The pity will be none
the less, however, for nothing so complements
delicious little pork chops for a luncheon dish
as apples so prepared. And pork chops, by
the way, are quite to be desired these cool
autumn days.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Apple Salad</div>

<p>Nothing can exceed the joy-giving properties
of an apple salad if it be rightly concocted.
For myself I prefer that there shall be a
judicious mixture of celery with the apple,
that the pepper, salt, and oil be added with a
sparing hand, and that without fail lemon
juice shall be used in place of vinegar. It
hardly seems necessary to say, and yet one
never knows just what is the proper stopping
place in giving advice, that a steel knife must
not be allowed to touch the apples, else what
might have been and should be a thing of
beauty is a damaging blight to an otherwise
perfectly appointed table. This kind of salad
is in its rightful place when accompanying
any variety of black duck, and just now wild
ducks are of prime flavor. The marketmen
know this, but I find that not many of them
know why these birds are to be in their best
estate for the next two months, when the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>157]</a></span>
reason as explained to me by sportsmen is
both sound and plausible, namely, that now
the birds are getting their feed where it is the
sweetest and best, along the shores of fresh
ponds, but later when Jack Frost shall have
done his perfect work they must hie them to
the salt marshes for sustenance, and very soon
thereafter the fact of their changed diet is
made manifest to those who dine from them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Pears in
Vanilla
Syrup</div>

<p>One can hardly talk of ways and means for
treating apples and leave unsaid one or two
directions for serving pears so that they shall
be quite good enough to do duty upon any
occasion. Have you ever tried peeling them,
splitting them in two lengthwise, scooping out
the core, cooking till tender in a syrup
strongly flavored with vanilla, and then draining
them, filling the hollows left by removing
the cores with powdered macaroons? If you
have, then you know how to complete the
pretty task; if not, then I will tell you that
after the macaroons have been added the two
parts of a pear must be put together, the
pears laid on their side alternately with tiny
rice croquettes which have been coated with
apricot marmalade or any preferred jam.
You may take the syrup in which the pears
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>158]</a></span>
were boiled and adding to it a little whipped
cream pour it over the whole. My word for
it, if the early part of your feast has consisted
of such delicacies as nightingales&rsquo; tongues and
plovers&rsquo; eggs, pears so prepared will seem
a fitting dessert, but if, as is more probable,
you have dined from a perfectly broiled
chicken (and they were never better and less
expensive than now), you will find this dish
of pears quite the crowning beauty of your
dinner that it deserves to be.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Stuffed
Stewed
Pears</div>

<p>And while we are on the subject of cooking
pears I will tell you of another way in which
I have always seen them find favor. After
they are cooked and the core scooped out I
fill them with a mixture of several kinds of
fruit, finely chopped, laying them on a shallow
dish of rice and cream, pouring syrup over
them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Pears
Stewed
in Claret</div>

<p>Now for another way of cooking pears as
they should be, to be &ldquo;not like other folks&rsquo;&rdquo;
pears: let me suggest that you get inexpensive,
oh very inexpensive claret in which to
stew pears the next time you see fit to have
them. Stew them till tender, then take them
out and add to the claret what sugar you
think is needed to have it sweet enough when
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>159]</a></span>
it is boiled down to about one-half the original
quantity. Pour over the pears and let cool
before serving. Sublimate this idea, if you
see fit, by sprinkling in chopped almonds or
chopped pistachios or any other little pleasantry
that occurs to your inventive genius,&mdash;that
is, if you&rsquo;ve an inventive genius that is to be
trusted.</p>

<hr class="break" />

<div class="sidenote">Fried
Chicken,
Italian Style</div>

<p>Suppose you find, on one of your trips to
market this month, as you probably will, that
poultry is very low in price, won&rsquo;t you give
this suggestion a trial? Cut a chicken up as
for a ragout, and boil it in as little water as
will cover it, seasoning the water with a small
onion, salt, white pepper, and a gill of sherry
wine. When the chicken is almost tender
enough, drain it from the liquor and let it get
perfectly cold. Meanwhile have in a stewpan
half a gill of olive oil, with a pinch of minced
onion and a little salt and pepper. When this
is quite hot and the chicken quite cold, cook
the chicken in it to a delicate brown. Dish
the chicken when it is browned evenly, and
pour over it a sauce made by adding a gill of
the stock in which it was boiled to the oil in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>160]</a></span>
the stewpan, thickening it all with the yolks
of two eggs. This makes a most delicious
dish and is well worth the trial. The
frying in oil gives it its distinctive flavor, and
makes it very different from fowl fried in
butter, which is in France always called
poulet saut&eacute;e, to mark the difference.</p>

<div class="sidenote">With
Tomatoes</div>

<p>And this same dish can be varied a little by
using tomatoes with the chicken. After the
chicken has been fried in the oil, lay it on
fried tomatoes, and then pour the sauce over
all. Have the tomatoes as large as possible
and not too ripe; slice them, dust them with
salt and pepper, and fry very, very slowly in
a little oil till they are cooked; but don&rsquo;t let
the slices get out of shape.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Roast Duck
with
Orange
Sauce<br />
<br />
Broiled
Devilled
Tomatoes</div>

<p>If you think you would prefer a roast of
poultry, do try ducks to be had now. Roast
them in any way that experience has taught
you is the best, but when it comes to making
the sauce for them, let me have a word to say.
Mince two or three slices of bacon and a
small onion and fry together for five
minutes; add to them the juice of an orange
and a wineglassful of port wine, the drippings
from the pan in which the ducks were roasted,
and a seasoning of salt and pepper. It&rsquo;s an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>161]</a></span>
ideal September dish, that&rsquo;s what it is. And
you might accompany it or follow it with
another that is particularly seasonable, namely,
broiled devilled tomatoes. First you mash
the yolks of three hard-boiled eggs, then you
mix with them a saltspoonful of salt, one teaspoonful
each of powdered sugar and mustard,
and as much cayenne as your taste calls for;
then stir in three ounces of melted butter, and
when all the ingredients are well blended add
three tablespoonfuls of vinegar. At this stage
put the mixture over the fire to reach the
boiling point, and stir in two well-beaten eggs.
When it has thickened a bit stand in hot
water on the stove to keep warm while you
give a little attention to the tomatoes. These
must be ripe and firm. Cut them in half-inch
slices, broil over a clear fire, place on a
hot dish, pour the sauce over them, and there
you are. This makes a really appetizing
breakfast dish as well as a savory dinner
course. Try it some morning, having with it
crisp broiled bacon and some dainty rice muffins,
and you will find yourself considerably
above par with your household for the rest of
that day at least.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Broiled
Tomatoes

<p>And in a day or so follow up the good
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>162]</a></span>
impression by having at luncheon tomatoes prepared
in this way: Cut some round slices of
bread and fry them delicately in butter till
they are brown. Slice firm, ripe tomatoes to
match the sizes of the bread slices; broil the
tomatoes just a wee bit, and then lay a slice
on each piece of the French bread. Season
them with pepper and salt, scatter grated
Parmesan cheese over them, spread them
with a layer of fine bread-crumbs moistened
with melted butter. Brown in a hot oven
and serve piping hot. And if the man o&rsquo; the
house is the right sort you will get a vote of
thanks in the shape of a big bunch of the
earliest and brightest chrysanthemums to be
found in town.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Celery and
Apple Salad</div>

<p>Have you ever made a salad of apples and
celery? Use sour apples cut into dice-shaped
pieces, and cut the celery into
half-inch bits. Arrange in the salad dish
in this way: A layer of the apple, then a
sprinkling of capers; next a layer of the celery,
and over this three or four olives cut in
thin slices, and so on till the dish is full.
Make a dressing of a saltspoonful of salt, a
good dash of cayenne pepper, the juice of a
lemon, and six tablespoonfuls of olive oil.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>163]</a></span>
Pour this over the apples and celery about
ten minutes before serving. Be sure that
you let the youngsters have all of this
salad that they want, for it will be hard to
concoct a more wholesome and healthful one.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Apple Sauce
with Orange
Juice<br />
<br />
With
Whipped
Cream</div>

<p>And I am going to suggest a variation or
two of the apple sauce theme for your approval.
Go ahead and get your apples ready
as you always have, and when you put them
on the stove to cook add to them the peel of
an orange. When the apples are quite cooked
press them through a sieve, add brown sugar
to them to taste, and the juice of one orange
to a pint of apple. Put this on the stove to
cook for about two minutes, and then put
aside to cool before serving. Or, stew your
apples till they are tender, press them through
a sieve, add to them the amount of sugar they
require, and when they are quite cold beat up
with them lightly some well-whipped cream&mdash;a
pint of cream after it is whipped to a
quart of apple sauce.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Pear Salad</div>

<p>Now, if it comes to pass that neither or
both of these ways of making apple sauce
finds favor with you, you will certainly give
an attentive ear to a hint on the subject of
pears. For one of the daintiest and most
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>164]</a></span>
seasonable of desserts is a pear salad. Know
how it is made? Have the pears quite ripe,
cut them in thin slices, lay them in a glass
dish, sprinkle powdered sugar on them,
pour over them a glass of brandy which has
in it a dozen drops or so of lemon juice, and
let stand on ice for about fifteen minutes
before serving. It is a good idea also to have
the pears on ice for two or three hours before
they are sliced.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Stuffed
Pears</div>

<p>Another delectable dessert made from pears
is called &ldquo;stuffed pears.&rdquo; Cut them in two
and scoop out the core with a vegetable
spoon. Cook the pears very gently in a little
syrup till they are quite tender. Drain them,
and have ready any kind of marmalade into
which you have stirred chopped almonds.
Stuff the pears with this and put them together
in their original shape. Have in a dish a
thin layer of boiled rice, over which you have
spread a little whipped cream. Arrange the
pears in a circle on the rice, and fill the centre
with the same kind of marmalade as that used
for stuffing the pears.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Stuffed
Peaches</div>

<p>And peaches may be prepared in just the
same way; but you may add just a few of the
kernels of the peaches to the syrup while you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>165]</a></span>
are stewing them, which will give them a delightful
flavor. Indeed, I think it is always
an improvement to use some of the kernels
when cooking peaches for any way of serving.
In tarts the kernels should be chopped as
finely as possible.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Peach Cream</div>

<p>Peach cream makes a dainty and delicious
dessert. Have a dozen ripe peaches, peel,
remove the stones, and then stew them
with half a dozen of the kernels in a syrup
made of half a pound of sugar and half a pint
of water. When the peaches are quite soft
press them through a sieve. Mix with the
pulp one pint of cream, whipped, and one
ounce of dissolved gelatine. Wet a fancy
mould with cold water, pour in the preparation,
and leave till firm. Unmould when serving.</p>

<p>To be sure, there&rsquo;s no way in the world that
a peach is so delightful as when eaten from the
hand, but it must be the very best sort of a
peach to be eaten in this way, and the best
sorts just now may be a thought expensive.
That is the reason I have suggested ways for
cooking them, because one can use an inferior
quality and yet get perfectly satisfactory results.
And that isn&rsquo;t possible with most of
life&rsquo;s commodities.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>HEN all the world adopts the
Pythagorean menu as its standard
of good living then I will bestir
myself and concoct the daintiest dishes possible
from those &ldquo;foods that are freshly chemicalized
by the sun&rsquo;s rays,&rdquo; and will gladly
give you the benefit of my experiences. But
I&rsquo;m no reformer, and until that day of universal
self-denial arrives I will continue the
tenor of my way along the old line, and try
to idealize commonplace, every-day viands
into dishes that pique the appetite, and make
of eating a delicate delight. A very material
vocation, it is true, but as matters stand a
highly useful one. Eh?</p>

<p>Now there are smelts, as plump and inviting
a fish as can be found in the market, and at
their best, too. But how many housekeepers
are there who ever think of serving them in
any way but just simply fried? Frequently,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>167]</a></span>
of course, they do serve them with a tartar
sauce, but nine times out of ten it would be
better for all concerned if the sauce were neglected
or forgotten, or upset, or anything that
would keep it away from the table.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Baked
Smelts</div>

<p>The next time you are to have smelts try
cooking them in this way: After they are
cleaned have them wiped till perfectly dry,
and lay them in a baking dish; over
them pour a wineglass of white wine, add
a sprinkling of salt and pepper, according
to your judgment, half a dozen whole
fresh mushrooms, and pour over them one-half
a pint of Spanish sauce. Sprinkle ever so
lightly with bread-crumbs and a little warmed
butter, and bake in a hot oven for twenty
minutes. This is the way you would prepare
a dozen or fifteen of the fish; of course for a
larger number the amount of seasoning, etc.,
would be increased proportionately. Garnish
the smelts before serving with thinly sliced
lemon, each slice sprinkled with chopped
parsley.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Broiled
Smelts with
B&eacute;arnaise</div>

<p>Or try broiling them, if you like. Split
the fish, using only the largest size, down the
backs; remove the backbones, wipe well
and then rub them with a little oil and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>168]</a></span>
season with salt and a bit of white pepper.
Broil in a double broiler for three minutes
on each side, over a hot fire. Have spread
on the bottom of the dish in which they
are to be served a layer of B&eacute;arnaise sauce;
arrange the smelts carefully and daintily on
this and sprinkle over them a scanty bit of
chopped parsley. You&rsquo;ll find this far and
away ahead of the eternal &ldquo;fried smelts and
sauce tartare.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="sidenote">Fried Smelts
with Parsley</div>

<p>But if you really feel that you must fry
them, then go about it in this way: First of
all, fry some thinly sliced bacon and in its fat
fry to a delicate brown the smelts which you
have previously dipped in sweet, rich cream,
and then dredged with flour to make a
thick paste around them. Serve garnished
with the bacon and with fried parsley. The
frying of parsley is as you know, a somewhat
ticklish job; it must be perfectly dry, put
into a frying basket and then plunged into hot
fat for just a few minutes&mdash;don&rsquo;t have the fat
too hot&mdash;this is where you must think and
act simultaneously&mdash;or the parsley will lose
its color, and then you will have to begin all
over again. After it is put on the dish squeeze
a few drops of lemon juice over it. My word
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>169]</a></span>
for it you will find this an acceptable dish,
whether it is prepared for breakfast, luncheon
or dinner.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Bluefish&mdash;Newport
Style</div>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t mean you to understand that I
considered smelts to be the only fish in the
market at present; I simply wanted to call
your attention to them as being as good as
any other, and a good deal better than they,
themselves, are at any other time of year.</p>

<p>Bluefish are good now, too; they are excellent,
really, and a bluefish at its best is hard
to beat. Have you ever tried cooking them
in the oven? Have them split, you know,
as for broiling, then put them into a well-greased
baking pan. Have ready half a cupful
of melted butter with the juice of an onion in
it and likewise the juice of a lemon, with a
reasonable amount of salt and of cayenne
pepper. Before the fish goes into the oven
moisten it well with the prepared butter, and
baste with the butter every ten minutes while
it is in the oven. When it is of a good even
brown it is done. Now, don&rsquo;t serve with the
bluefish cooked in this way potatoes of any
sort or kind. Have cucumbers, hothouse, of
course, and have them fried. Cut them into
thick slices and remove the seeds; then soak
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>170]</a></span>
them in equal parts of ice-water and vinegar,
well salted, for one hour. Take them out,
drain and wipe dry and fry in boiling lard
until a light brown. They are not only good
when served with bluefish cooked in this way,
but they are appetizing bits to accompany
pork or lamb chops when you are serving
them with a brown sauce.</p>

<p>So much for to-day&rsquo;s fish story. As for
meat, anybody can get good meats at any time
of the year if they will go to a man who knows
how to cut them, and won&rsquo;t insist on dickering
with him about the price.</p>

<p>Domestic ducks are now in good condition.
You might get one of them and try preparing
it in some new way to be used, if it&rsquo;s a success,
on Thanksgiving Day. Say stuffing it
with mushrooms; use one can of mushrooms
to three heaping cupfuls of stale bread-crumbs;
one-half a cupful of melted butter, with salt
and pepper. If the stuffing appears to be too
dry moisten it with a bit of milk. Split the
mushrooms and use all their liquor; if the
duck is too small to require the full amount
you may add some of the mushrooms to the
giblet gravy to be served with it.</p>

<p>And there is plenty of material in market
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>171]</a></span>
for green salads; there are celery and lettuce,
the stand-bys; watercress, escarolle, romaine,
and chicory. Try this latter some time
soon, using a plain dressing of oil, vinegar,
salt and pepper for it, with bits of Roquefort
cheese sprinkled over it. If any among you
object to eating this cheese because of its odor,
rest easy, for you may have at hand a counteracting
force in the Bar-le-Duc currants. They
do, as you probably are aware, put the finishing
touch to almost any sort of dinner, but
when particularly strong cheese has been
served they are nothing short of a godsend.</p>

<hr class="break" />

<p>To the ordinary reader the name of Bontoux
conveys nothing; to the Parisian of a
generation or two ago it was synonymous
with all that was delightful in the way of food
and drink. The shop over which Madame
Bontoux presided remains in the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Rue de
l&rsquo;&Eacute;chelle</span>, but Madame, herself, has been
gathered to her forefathers. Originally she
had been a <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cordon bleu</span>, and in the early
forties opened a small establishment in the
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Rue Montesquieu</span>, which establishment, if
I mistake not, is mentioned in Sue&rsquo;s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>172]</a></span>
&ldquo;Seven Cardinal Sins.&rdquo; Thence she moved
to the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Rue de l&rsquo;&Eacute;chelle</span>, where she died.
Acting on the whim of the moment, she
would sell her wares only to those whom she
liked, and those whom she did not like might
offer her a hundred times their value in vain.
The <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Rue de l&rsquo;&Eacute;chelle</span> being near the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Com&eacute;die
Fran&ccedil;aise</span>, Rachel, who was a gourmet of the
first water, frequently went to the shop after
rehearsals. One afternoon she went in while
one of the shopmen was busy packing a
hamper for Nicholas I. Among the delicacies
there were a dozen magnificent quails on
a skewer. &ldquo;I want those,&rdquo; said Rachel in
the imperious way she adopted now and then.
&ldquo;You will have to want, my little woman,&rdquo;
replied Madame, shaking her head in her
enormous bonnet, which seemed a fixture; no
one had ever seen her without it. Then
Rachel toned down. &ldquo;I will give you ten
francs apiece for them,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Not for
ten crowns apiece,&rdquo; came the retort, and in a
voice which left the great actress no doubt as
to its meaning.</p>

<p>Rachel was disappointed, and rose from her
chair to go. Just when she had reached the
door an idea flashed on her. She turned
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>173]</a></span>
round and began to recite the famous lines
from Corneille&rsquo;s &ldquo;Horace.&rdquo; The effect was
electrical on the shopman, who dropped the
quails. Madame Bontoux was not so easily
impressed. She kept shaking her head just
as if to say &ldquo;You may save yourself the
trouble, my girl;&rdquo; but all of a sudden, when
Rachel brought out the last line&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Moi seule en &ecirc;tre cause et mourir de plaisir</i>,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>she jumped up. &ldquo;Give her the dozen quails
and a pheasant besides.&rdquo; Wonderful to
relate, the enormous bonnet had got pushed
on one side.</p>

<p>Now, there&rsquo;s a very pretty question to be
discussed at your dinner table o&rsquo; Sunday
night: Were those birds <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">&agrave; bon march&eacute;</i> for
Rachel, or did Madame Bontoux, in the
language of to-day, &ldquo;get the best of the
bargain?&rdquo;</p>

<p>When you go to market in search of game
in these days, and the marketman, leading you
in the direction of the ice-box wherein he
keeps his choicest wares, says, &ldquo;Look at &rsquo;em;
ain&rsquo;t they beauties?&rdquo; you will be quite safe in
acquiescing by a plain yea or a nod, but do
not go to the extent of ordering a dozen quail,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>174]</a></span>
or woodcock, or snipe, or any other game
bird, in fact, until you have ascertained if
the legs are smooth and the quill feathers
soft, which facts prove them to be young
birds. Furthermore, be sure that the
breasts are hard, firm, and well-covered with
flesh, for this will show them to be in good
condition.</p>

<p>Once the birds are under your roof-tree
see to it that the cook does not draw the
trail from the woodcock or snipe, for by all
gourmets this is reckoned a great delicacy,
and, by the way, though, of course, it is a
matter of common knowledge, the heads of
these birds are the most delicious morsels
of all. Another point to be borne in mind
is that when preparing game for cooking it
should never be washed inside, but merely
well wiped with a clean cloth.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Toast for
Game</div>

<p>Partridges, grouse and quail are of so fine
a flavor that it is little short of a criminal
act to serve them in any way but roasted
or broiled. If they are to be broiled and
served on toast, then a delicious way of
preparing the toast is to have the giblets
boiled till they are so tender that they can
be pounded to a paste with a little of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>175]</a></span>
water in which they were boiled, and then,
when mixed with an equal amount of butter,
spread over the toast. This giblet butter
may be varied to suit a variety of tastes.
A little chopped parsley may be added, or
a squeeze of lemon juice, or both, in which
case a complementary dash of cayenne must
be added. The meat of the partridge is so
dry that it is well to serve with it a sauce
made of melted butter, slightly seasoned
with onion and a dash of white wine, or
a tartar sauce is really excellent with broiled
partridge.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sauce for
Partridge</div>

<p>If these birds&mdash;partridges, grouse, and
quail&mdash;are to be roasted, the garnishing in
either case must consist of seasoned watercress.
With the partridge is served a bread sauce,
but it&rsquo;s a custom as old as the hills, and
for that very reason I have tried many experiments
to find a sauce more to my liking.
I have found it, and this is the way I prepare
it: half a pint of clear stock, preferably
white, seasoned with onion juice, a bunch
of parsley, a bay-leaf, and four cloves, strained
through a napkin before using. The birds
will be much better if an ounce of butter is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>176]</a></span>
placed inside of them before cooking, and if
they are occasionally basted with melted
butter during the process of roasting.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Roasted
Grouse</div>

<p>Grouse need no sauce, especially if before
they are put into the oven they are stuffed
with one slice of bread each which has been
toasted and dipped in Madeira wine. They
may be larded, or barded, or basted with
melted butter while roasting, if it is thought
likely to improve their flavor.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Roasted
Quail</div>

<p>Beware of cooks who assure you that they
know how to roast quail until you have seen
their skill put to the test. It is a failing
common to too many cooks to over-roast
these dainty little birds. Fourteen to sixteen
minutes in a hot oven is quite long enough
to cook them to the point favored by epicurean
palates. They should be served on
bread sliced and fried, and with them, if
desired, a very little of the clear sauce above
recommended for partridges.</p>

<p>Any of the pieces left from these birds
roasted may be daintily served with a mayonnaise
dressing, and you may be willing to
assert that the last state of that bird was
better than the first.</p>

<p>It was with the intention of preparing a
dinner according to the above menu that I
went about my duties &ldquo;all on a market day,&rdquo;
for it seemed to me upon looking it over to
be a dainty repast for four people, and
one wherein neither parsimony nor extravagance
held the trick hand. And a safe middle
course in one&rsquo;s daily regimen tends quite as
much to health and prosperity in individual
and nation as does the same policy in seemingly
weightier matters.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Velvet Soup</div>

<p>The velvet soup is easy of accomplishment,
as one need only to have a quart of some
simple white stock on hand, made from veal
or poultry remnants, into which is stirred the
minced red part of four carrots seasoned with
pepper and salt and stewed till tender in butter,
two tablespoonfuls of tapioca which has
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>178]</a></span>
been soaked for four hours in cold water, and
then let the whole boil for nearly an hour
before straining and serving. It is not only
easily prepared, but it is easily digested, as a
soup should always be which precedes a rather
rich fish course similar to that given above.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Baked
Halibut with
Parmesan</div>

<p>About a pound and a half of halibut, at
eighteen cents the pound, will be required,
and it should be boiled till tender enough to
flake lightly; then, if you have a rather deep
dish, with a border of mashed potato about
the inside, all will go smoothly. Into the
bottom of the dish put a layer of white sauce
made of half a pint of boiling milk, three
ounces of butter and a little salt, thickened
with flour; sprinkle in flakes of the fish,
then a layer of the sauce, adding a little milk
if it promises to be too dry, and so on till the
dish is full, having a layer of sauce on top.
Then scatter grated Parmesan over all, and
brown to a tempting shade.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Roasted Duck
with Olives</div>

<p>With ducklings tender and toothsome, as
they should be in this month, it is plainly
seen that the next course is capable of being a
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pi&egrave;ce de r&eacute;sistance</i> at a far more stately affair
even than the one which we are considering.
But if they are roasted in the ordinary way
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>179]</a></span>
known to every housekeeper in the land,
stuffed with bread crumbs, highly seasoned,
and have a giblet sauce, quite an extraordinary
flavor will be given them if, just before serving,
half a pint of pitted and quartered olives
are added to the sauce. It&rsquo;s only a trifling
addition to the old way, you see, but the improvement
is so great you will wonder
that every one doesn&rsquo;t know of the gastronomical
harmony existing between duck and olives.
Now, the flavor of the ducks is so rich
and altogether satisfying that it takes only
the simplest and mildest-flavored vegetable to
complement this course. And nothing will
answer the purpose better than cauliflower.
If they are cut into pieces of uniform size,
they cook in a much more satisfactory
manner, and they should boil as gently
as possible; do not add the salt to the
water till they are nearly tender. When
taking them up, drain well, and over all pour
melted butter thickened with browned bread-crumbs,
and send to table. I fancy you will
find them more to your liking served in this
way than in the old rutty way of so many
cooks, namely, with a white sauce, which
varies in different households from a fair
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>180]</a></span>
quality of flour paste to a very rich and fairly
cloying concoction of cream and melted
butter.</p>

<p>There is nothing like a simple salad to
prepare one&rsquo;s palate for the sweets which come
at the last, and with hothouse cucumbers now
in evidence and lettuce always with us, the
making of a salad is a delight in more ways
than one. It is not so many years ago that
we had to pay from thirty-five to fifty cents
each for cucumbers at this season of the year,
but the large number of cucumber hothouses
near every city is fast bringing this desirable
vegetable to a state where it will be known
as an all-the-year-round commodity.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Macaroon
Charlotte</div>

<p>There are a good many people, and the
number is increasing, who declare that to them
a dinner is finished by a bit of cheese after the
salad, and finished quite to their satisfaction,
too. But for those whose dinner is incomplete
without a bit of sweetness, I would
recommend a macaroon charlotte made by
lining a dish with broken macaroons and then
filling the dish with whipped cream which has
been sweetened and flavored to taste; adding
to it at last half a pound of crystallized
cherries.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>181]</a></span>
As to the wines, of course, it&rsquo;s a matter of
purse and principle whether or not they
shall be served. I have suggested the kinds
appropriate to the courses, for the reason that
I have heard many a hostess &ldquo;on hospitable
thoughts intent&rdquo; wonder &ldquo;what wine goes
with what.&rdquo;</p>

<hr class="break" />

<p>To be sure, I went a-marketing t&rsquo;other
day, and I was able to collect a stock of
valuable information which I came home
prepared to dish up for the delectation of
any who chose to read and profit by it.
But by some chance, or mischance, it occurred
to me that All-Hallows Eve is near
at hand, and that when it comes you girls
will be up to all sorts of pranks. Now,
years and years ago I was a girl myself, and
I can dimly recall that the playing of pranks
on the fairies&rsquo; anniversary night induced a
desire for liquid refreshment, either for the
purpose of chirking up one&rsquo;s spirits when the
omens proved unfavorable or for helping out
the general merry-making when the signs
foretold bliss.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Claret Tipple</div>

<p>And a drink that seemed to me at that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>182]</a></span>
time apropos of either event we used to make
by slicing half a dozen juicy apples and three
lemons as a starting point. Then we would
lay them alternately in a large bowl, sprinkling
each layer plentifully with sugar, and
over all would pour a quart of claret. Then
we would let it stand for fully six hours, pour
it through a muslin bag, and it was ready for
use.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Hot Spiced
Claret</div>

<p>If you desire a hot drink, and it is likely
that you will, if the tricks you have on hand
call you out of doors at midnight, you might
prepare one in this way: Have half-a-dozen
lumps of sugar, the juice of half a lemon, four
whole allspice, two whole cloves and half a
teaspoonful of ground cinnamon in a dish;
over it pour half a pint of claret and let it boil
for just two minutes, stirring it all the time.
Strain it into hot glasses and grate just a little
nutmeg on top as you serve it. At the first
sip the good qualities of this libation will present
themselves to you.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Hot Claret
Egg-nog</div>

<p>And for an encore you might vary it a little
bit in this way: Stir together two tablespoonfuls
of sugar, the juice of half a lemon,
half a teaspoonful of mixed spices and half a
pint of claret. Boil this for two minutes and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>183]</a></span>
then pour it over the yolks of two eggs that
have been beaten well with a teaspoonful of
sugar. Stir all the while that you are pouring
the wine slowly over the eggs. Grate a little
nutmeg over the top after you have poured
the mixture into hot glasses. Now mind,
don&rsquo;t get confused and pour the eggs into the
wine, for that would spoil everything; pour
the wine over the eggs. And be thankful
that you have lived long enough to concoct
such a satisfying drink as this always proves
itself to be.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Hot Sherry
Egg-nog</div>

<p>But if you feel that you must find a use for
the whites of the eggs dissolve a tablespoonful
of powdered sugar in half a pint of hot water,
add to it half a pint of sherry wine and let
this come to a boil. Meanwhile have the
whites of the eggs beaten to a froth and pour
the hot mixture over them, stirring rapidly.
Pour into hot glasses, grating a bit of nutmeg
over the top of each. See to it that the vessel
in which you boil the wine is thoroughly
clean. You don&rsquo;t want even the faintest trace
of a taste of anything besides the ingredients

<p>An orange punch isn&rsquo;t just the innocent

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>184]</a></span>
But that doesn&rsquo;t hinder its being a treat for
the palate. Infuse the peel of three and the
juice of six oranges with three-quarters of a
pound of loaf sugar in two quarts of boiling
water for half an hour. Strain and add to
the juice a half pint of brandy and a liqueur
glass of maraschino. And it is quite likely
that you will think it needs a little more
sugar; if so, add it. Now it may be that
you will like this hot, or it may be that you
will like it cold; in the latter case cool it on
the ice for several hours before serving or ice
it when serving. This is also an excellent
recipe for lemon punch&mdash;substituting lemons
for the oranges.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Cider Punch</div>

<p>If you really long for drinks which seem
suitable for days the &ldquo;saddest of the year,&rdquo;
why then see to it that your cider jug is
filled with sweet cider as a prerequisite, and
go ahead. Call your first effort a cider punch.
Peel a lemon and pour half a pint of sherry
on the peeling; to the juice of the lemon add
a cupful of sugar, a little grated nutmeg and
a quart of cider. Mix this together thoroughly
and then add to it the rind of the lemon
and the sherry. Let it get perfectly cold on
the ice, or if you are short of time ice it when
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>185]</a></span>
serving. Now if you wish to make this punch
a bit more insidious you can easily do so by
adding to it a wineglass of brandy. It will
be quite as palatable also, I think you will
find.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Cider
Egg-nog</div>

<p>And then cider egg-nog is well worth the
making and the drinking. Use a large glass;
beat up in it an egg and a scant teaspoonful
of sugar; put in half a dozen small lumps of
ice, fill the glass with cider and grate a little
nutmeg on top. This is not only a very
pleasant drink, but it is an extremely wholesome
one. It will act as a pick-me-up many
times when one is tired or not feeling quite
up to the mark.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Quince
Liqueur</div>

<p>Another delicious potation that will be
found of use at all sorts of occasions is quince
liqueur. Grate a sufficient number of quinces
to make a quart of juice after it is squeezed
through a jelly bag. With this juice mix a
pound of sugar, six ounces of bitter almonds,
bruised, a dozen whole cloves and a gill of
brandy. Mix these all well together and set
away in a demijohn for ten days at least.
Then strain it through the jelly bag till it
is perfectly clear, and bottle for use. Besides
drinking this as a liqueur, you will find
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>186]</a></span>
that you can vary and improve a number
of your recipes for punch by adding just a
suspicion of it to them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Various Cups</div>

<p>At all times cups are alluring decoctions,
don&rsquo;t you think? And there are many varieties
of them. But they all begin in the same
way. A cordial glass each of maraschino,
benedictine and brandy put into a quart jug,
and then if you fill the jug with champagne
you have champagne cup, with Rhine wine
you have Rhine wine cup, and with cider you
have cider cup. If you use claret you add
a few drops of lemon juice and double the
quantity of maraschino.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Rhine Wine
Seltzer</div>

<p>But it may be that you prefer to take your
Rhine wine with seltzer; if so, just half fill
the glass with the wine and pour enough
seltzer to fill it. Both the wine and the seltzer
should be kept on the ice for some little time
before using.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Ginger
Lemonade</div>

<p>If after all this array of non-temperance
drinks you feel that you should turn
your attention to something milder, and
yet can&rsquo;t quite make up your mind to clear
cold water, why not try a ginger lemonade?
Have a teaspoonful of powdered sugar in a
tumbler, add to it the juice of half a lemon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>187]</a></span>
and fill the tumbler with ginger ale that has
been well iced. You will find this a pleasant
change from the ordinary lemonade, and for
many persons it serves to make ginger ale a
deal more palatable.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Soda
Cocktail</div>

<p>Now, if you should feel that you would
like to serve a drink that is as innocent and
harmless as so much milk, but that when
judged by its name alone seems to be intended,
oh, my! for very dissipated persons, indeed!
let me suggest to you a soda cocktail. Fill a
glass with lemon soda, put into it a dash of
raspberry syrup and on top of it a thin slice
of orange. And, your very good health.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">O</span>NCE upon a time, a somebody who
was famous for his or her wit or
wisdom, or for both qualities, remarked
that oftentimes the easiest and best
way to get over a difficulty was to go round
it. To my great regret, I can&rsquo;t give you the
name of the author of the very pithy saying,
neither can I tell you just what conditions
called it forth, but it&rsquo;s safe to say that its
context was a suggestion or opinion offered
for the settling of some great big question of
state. But, what is more to the point, I can
be of help in showing you, I hope, how to
make a practical application of the epigram to
every-day affairs. Because, just as sure as we
are living, there is always a way to go round
if one can&rsquo;t get over the very toughest hands
that one gets in life&rsquo;s shuffle.</p>

<p>Now, there&rsquo;s the servant-girl question in
its Sunday-night aspect. It exists; it can&rsquo;t
be wiped out; and it is impossible to ignore
it. She, or they, as the case may be, will have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>189]</a></span>
&ldquo;the evening out,&rdquo; come what may, and
guests are pretty sure to come o&rsquo; Sunday
nights. Of course you can&rsquo;t send them home
supperless, and neither can you send your
family to bed in a semi-famished condition.
No; you must go round the situation. And
it&rsquo;s not so hard. Indeed, my last trip to
market, which included a call at the grocer&rsquo;s,
was for the express purpose of picking up
points that would make the circuit easy for
you.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not going to say a word, here, about
the chafing-dish. And I will tell you why.
It is the custom in a large number of families
for the man of the house to preside at the
chafing-dish Sunday nights, and while my
stock of book-learning is very diminutive, I
have learned that under no circumstances is
it wise to offer suggestions to a man who
thinks he can cook.</p>

<p>Frequently it is easy to have some little
dish left ready by the cook which needs only
to be heated before it is served, but in nine
households out of ten cold viands are the staple
commodity. And the singular sameness is
surprising and saddening. If one is in the
habit of dropping in to &ldquo;pot luck&rdquo; at the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>190]</a></span>
houses of one&rsquo;s <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">intimes</i>, one soon learns to
reckon with a fair degree of certainty upon
what will be likely to be set before one.</p>

<p>Now, there are sandwiches. Once let a
housekeeper acquire a reputation for a particular
brand of that edible, and it&rsquo;s like getting
her to change her religion to induce her to
try making any other sort. But it requires
only a very little time, with a fair amount of
common sense, to have a sandwich repertoire
that will enable one to get through a fairly
long season without repetitions.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Caviare
Sandwiches</div>

<p>The next time you are to have caviare sandwiches,
try using brown-bread, sliced as thinly
as possible, spread with unsalted butter, and
then with a layer of caviare and a sprinkling
of lemon juice. And you will find them as
good as they are uncommon.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Oyster
Sandwiches<br />
<br />
Fish and
Game
Sandwiches</div>

<p>Then there are oyster sandwiches. Cook
the oysters a bit, or till they are firm, then
when they are cool stir them into good stiff
mayonnaise, with a seasoning of red pepper
and just a few capers. Spread day-old bread
with this mixture and finish off, sandwich
fashion. You can use cold fish of any sort
in this way; having the bits very small, and
adding chopped gherkins to the mayonnaise.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>191]</a></span>
And, better yet, use in this way any bits of
cold game, or poultry, using with them chopped
olives and chopped truffles. In either
case, you may if you like lay a lettuce
leaf on the bread and put the mixture on that.
But for myself I have always disliked the
addition of lettuce to sandwiches.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Savory
Butters</div>

<p>It is very easy to have savory butters,
&ldquo;beurres compos&eacute;s,&rdquo; so familiar to the French
cuisine, and so give an infinite variety of
taste to any kind of sandwiches. Take, for
instance, unsalted butter and season it well
with anchovy essence, some very finely
chopped parsley, a bit of paprika, and spread
thin slices of bread with it and then use a
layer of any kind of cold meat. Or you
can use shrimp essence, or in fact any essence
or sauce that you think would prove to be a
favorite.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Crust
Sandwiches</div>

<p>One of the most palatable ways, it seems to
me, in which to make sandwiches is to take
paste, not puff paste that is too rich, and roll
it out as thinly as possible; cut it into
rounds of uniform size spread around with a
certain mixture, then cover it with another
round of the paste, pinch the edges together
and bake them till they are brown. As to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>192]</a></span>
the mixtures, they may be made of an endless
number of savory viands. Say bloater
paste softened so that it will spread easily
with a little melted butter. And then there
are all sorts of potted meats and devilled
things that seem almost as if they were made
expressly to be used in this way. Believe me,
you will find these sandwiches ever so dainty
if you get them small enough and thin
enough, and, by the way, they make a capital
appointment for the five-o&rsquo;clock tea-table.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sweet
Sandwiches</div>

<p>Now for the sweet sandwiches. They may
be made with either white bread, cake, or
wafers&mdash;preferably the last. Have some
icing made by your favorite rule and sprinkle
into it chopped nuts of any kind and spread
the wafers with it. Or, use chopped crystallized
fruits and cherries preserved in maraschino;
and then try, the next time you make
this sort of sweets, some brandied fruits with
the icing. You might make a chocolate
icing and add to that some chopped
pistachios or almonds or preserved ginger.
But surely you&rsquo;ve enough now in the way of
a ground plan for the making of any number
of dainty and appetizing bouch&eacute;es.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Savory Jelly</div>

<p>Just a word about jellied things. You
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>193]</a></span>
can have a pint of stock, white if possible,
season it with an onion, a bay-leaf, a bit of
thyme, a clove, and pepper and salt. Then
put in a good half-ounce of dissolved gelatine;
and turn about one quarter of it, after
straining, into a mould and set on ice to
cool. Have the rest of the jelly in a liquid
state, but perfectly cold. When that in the
mould is set, have any sort of cold meat,
chicken, turkey, ham or tongue cut into
strips free of skin and bone, and pack it
into the mould with alternate layers of the
jelly, finishing with the latter. Now see how
successful you can be in making such a dish a
joy to the eye. Use sliced olives, gherkins,
capers, truffles, fanciful shapes of beet or anything
that your artistic eye will permit, and
sprinkle these through the dish as you go
along. Run a thin knife blade in between
the jelly and mould and then plunge the
mould into boiling water and the jelly will
unmould easily.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Cheese Salad</div>

<p>Then there are salads. To make one of
cheese rub the yolk of a hard-boiled egg in a
basin with a tablespoonful of salad oil;
add one teaspoonful of salt, a bit of cayenne
and a little made mustard; when all is well
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>194]</a></span>
mixed stir in about half a pound of grated
Parmesan cheese, the juice of an onion, and a
tablespoon of vinegar. Serve on lettuce
leaves. You will find that this will go particularly
well with sandwiches of bloater paste.</p>

<p>But for a salad to be served with a jellied
meat, make one of nuts, one kind or several,
broken into bits, mixed with an equal quantity
of sliced olives and spread with only a very
little mayonnaise.</p>

<p>I did want to tell you of ways to make
some very appetizing beverages, for the sort
of occasions we are discussing, but they will
have to wait. And perhaps it&rsquo;s just as well;
already my conscience is troubling me for fear
that you are going to be so taken up with the
goodies I have told you of that you will have
no inclination to think on &ldquo;better things&rdquo;
when it comes Sunday. But it can&rsquo;t be
helped now.</p>

<hr class="break" />

<p>Last spring a certain Boston man with
his family moved into the country. Not
so far out, however, but that he could
come to town daily to attend to business, and
yet far enough from the gilded dome to be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>195]</a></span>
able to buy sufficient land for a small farm
without paying all creation for it. The next
move was the stocking of the farm. So a
Jersey cow was bought to keep the family
supplied with cream, a flock of prize hens
was set at work in a bran new henhouse that
there might be fresh eggs on hand, and last
but not least, a pair of tiny young pigs were
secured to provide the household with sweet,
home-made pork when winter should set in.
And having secured the stock, the owner proceeded
at once to make pets, collectively and
individually, of the whole equipment. Actually
the cow would manage to look half-way
intelligent when he stroked her neck and told
her she was the sort that deserved to live in
clover the year round; the hens really did
add a note to their regular cackle when the
master was about, to show him that they knew
who gave them heaping measures of grain,
and the pigs, which he called Tim and Jim,
got in no time to know their names when they
were spoken by his voice. Well, cold weather
came on and with it those crisp, frosty
mornings when a toothsomely seasoned sausage
with a potato pur&eacute;e makes an ideal
breakfast. So Tim and Jim went the way of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>196]</a></span>
all pork, and in due course of time their
owner had the satisfaction of seeing on his
own breakfast table pork &ldquo;of his own raising.&rdquo;
And what do you think happened then?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Susan,&rdquo; said he to his wife, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t do
it; if you will believe me, I can&rsquo;t eat that
pork. Give it away&mdash;give it all away. Never
have any more put on this table. Why, dash
it all, Susan, I may be a ninny, but I was
actually fond of Tim and Jim, and don&rsquo;t see
what I was thinking of when I had them
killed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Samuel,&rdquo; said the wife, a woman who
knew how and when to point a moral, &ldquo;you
needn&rsquo;t call yourself a ninny; be thankful
for the feeling you have, because it can give
you a glimpse, though from afar off, of the
mighty power that will make of us a nation of
vegetarians, if we ever do become such.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And I, when I heard of this little episode,
fell to wondering if it would be such terribly
hard lines after all to be put on a strictly vegetarian
diet. At any rate, I managed to turn
out one dinner, sans fish, sans flesh, sans fowl,
that didn&rsquo;t appear in the least like a substitute
for something better. You shall have the
menu:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>197]</a></span></p>

<p class="menu">Consomm&eacute; with asparagus points.<br />
Mushroom cannelons.<span class="mspace3">&nbsp;</span>Poached eggs with tomato.<br />
<span class="mpadright3">Macaroni with cheese.</span><br />
<span class="mpadleft3">String beans with butter.</span><br />
Walnut salad.<br />
Lemon souffl&eacute;.<span class="mspace3">&nbsp;</span>Coffee.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Consomm&eacute;
with
Asparagus</div>

<p>As I was determined to be thoroughly
conscientious in the preparation of this dinner,
using stock for the soup was quite out of the
question, so I prepared it in this way: A
couple of onions, a carrot and a bunch of
herbs fried in plenty of butter till of a good
brown. Add to them a bunch of celery
chopped, with salt and pepper for seasoning,
and a tiny bit of sugar. Cover with water
and boil till the vegetables are quite tender.
Strain and add to the liquid a dash of sherry, a
few drops of lemon juice and some asparagus
points that have been cooked by themselves
till tender. Of course, the asparagus you will
buy in tins or glass just now, but for use in
this way it is quite as good as though freshly
cut. You will be surprised, I fancy, when
you see how savory a soup you have turned
out.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Cannelons of
Mushrooms</div>

<p>It isn&rsquo;t often that we feel justified in buying
fresh mushrooms at this time of year, but at a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>198]</a></span>
dinner of this sort where one is not obliged to
pay for a steak or for game, one can afford to
be a little bit reckless in the matter of vegetables,
especially when they are to be put to
such a delicious use as the making of cannelons.
Coarsely mince a pound or so of
well-wiped mushrooms and toss them with a
little minced parsley in butter till nicely
browned; then season with white pepper and
salt, adding a little more butter to moisten
the mushrooms till they are quite cooked.
Then stir in&mdash;off the fire&mdash;the yolks of
three eggs, a squeeze of lemon juice, and set
the whole aside to cool. Roll out some puff
or very short paste thin, cut it out in oblongs,
put a good spoonful of the mushroom mixture
on each oblong, roll these up like sausages,
moistening the edges to make them adhere,
brush them over with egg and fry in plenty
of oil or in butter. For myself, I prefer the
oil, and the using of oil for frying purposes
isn&rsquo;t the extravagant act that it seems at the
first flush to be, because it wastes very little
and can be used repeatedly for different
purposes.</p>

<p>The cannelons are to be served with the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>199]</a></span>
poached eggs and tomato. And the directions
for preparing the latter dish are to be found
elsewhere in this book.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Macaroni
with Cheese</div>

<p>The macaroni with cheese you know all
about, I dare say. Is this your way of doing
it? Break the macaroni into two-inch lengths
and drop into boiling salted water. When it
is quite tender pour cold water over it, drain
and stir about in plenty of melted butter till
each piece is well covered, then put into a
baking-dish, strew grated Parmesan cheese
over it and let brown in a hot oven. Just a
little bit of cayenne added to the cheese
improves the flavor wonderfully, to my
thinking.</p>

<div class="sidenote">String Beans
with Butter</div>

<p>You can find green string beans at the
provisioner&rsquo;s yet, or you can get them tinned,
as you choose. I shall not presume to advise
you as to that, but for the cooking of them I
will say a word or two. Boil them till perfectly
tender, then drain well and place
them in a pan with a tablespoonful or more
of fine herbs (minced chives or minced shallot
and parsley), with pepper, salt and lemon
juice and two ounces of butter; toss them
over the fire till the butter is melted and
serve.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>200]</a></span>
Perhaps this isn&rsquo;t the place to go into a
discussion of the circumstances that have
landed us as a nation at a point where we
think we must have turkey on Thanksgiving
Day, or be accused of showing a disrespect
for the Declaration of Independence. But
some time the matter will be attacked by somebody
who will spend a decade or so in the
Astor Library or the Boston Athen&aelig;um to
discover who said &ldquo;turkey&rdquo; first and where
they said it. Evidently it was said in one
of those voices that are heard around the
world and its echoes have not begun to
diminish, so far as my ear can detect, even
yet. So turkey it is, I suppose.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Grape Fruit
with Rum</div>

<p>But this little talk shall be of the addenda
of the dinner. Know what addenda means,
don&rsquo;t you? Well, call them &ldquo;fixin&rsquo;s,&rdquo; then.
Nowadays grape fruit is a hard and fast
&ldquo;fixin&rsquo;&rdquo; of a Thanksgiving Day dinner.
Before the soup it comes on cut in halves
with the seeds removed and also all of the
white pith in the centre of each half with a
pair of sharp scissors. Then by the taste of
them it is evident that about an hour before
they were put on the table they had a lump
of sugar and a teaspoonful of rum put into
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>201]</a></span>
each half, after which little refection they
reposed on the ice till wanted. Don&rsquo;t go on
the principle that if a little rum is good more
must be better and try to float the fruit in&mdash;that
would have been hailed as a rank outrage
even by Captain Shaddock himself&mdash;but just
be content to see how potent a little bit of
rum can be in good company.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Grape Fruit
Sorbet<br />
<br />
Fruit Salad</div>

<p>If you want a grape fruit sorbet, thinking
it best to begin your dinner with
oysters, you may pick out the pulp with a
fork in sizable bits, free from seeds and pith,
cover these bits with sherry and with a sprinkling
of sugar and freeze. You know the
rest&mdash;how to serve it and the like. But you
may be firm in the conviction that when grape
fruit comes to your table it doesn&rsquo;t make its
appearance till dessert. If so, you will allow
me to put in just a word, won&rsquo;t you? The
word is to advise you to get the pulp out as
recommended for the sorbet, mix with it an
equal quantity of Malaga grapes cut in halves
with seeds removed, covered with sugar and
sherry and iced for three or four hours before
serving.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know whether it is true or not but
it seems to me more than likely that the mushroom
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>202]</a></span>
hunters for science&rsquo; sake are doing &ldquo;us
folks&rdquo; who like good things to eat a kind
turn by getting out so many books on the
subject of good, bad, and indifferent sorts.
At any rate, they are getting to be more plentiful
every year and consequently should be
lower in price. Thanksgiving Day seems to
be a pretty appropriate time for having them.
You must spread yourself on that day, even
if you live on bread and cheese for the rest
of the month. Have them then and by themselves
after the table is cleared of the &ldquo;bird and
its fixin&rsquo;s,&rdquo; and have them in croquettes.</p>

<hr class="break" />

<p>Of course, you knew just what to have for
dinner on Thanksgiving Day, and if perchance
you didn&rsquo;t there were plenty at hand to tell
you how the menu should be composed. So
just let me advise you how to prepare two or
three dishes, to be called Thanksgiving <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en
r&eacute;chauff&eacute;e</i>, if it will make things seem any more
prosperous to you.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Broiled
Turkey Legs</div>

<p>Yes, I shall begin with turkey, because in
nine families out of ten, or perhaps ninety-and-nine
out of a hundred would be a closer estimate,
that bird formed the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pi&egrave;ce de r&eacute;sistance</i>.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>203]</a></span>
You know that if there&rsquo;s plenty to &ldquo;go
round&rdquo; at the first serving of a turkey the
legs are generally left untouched; the carver
doesn&rsquo;t feel like giving them to any one, and
when it comes to waiting on himself he thinks
he is entitled to a choicer bit. And so he is.
But you can use those legs all in good time.
Just gash them three or four times with a
very sharp knife, sprinkle them over with
salt, pepper and a few drops of lemon juice
and broil them over a hot fire till browned
well; put them on a hot dish, pour a little
melted butter over them and send to table.
They will go uncommonly well, say for a
Sunday morning breakfast to help out with a
bacon omelet.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Broiled
Devilled
Turkey Legs<br />
<br />
Potato
Omelet</div>

<p>But if they are to do duty at luncheon,
devil them before broiling. Season them with
salt and pepper and then rub lightly with
mustard which has been mixed with oil. Turn
the legs often while they are broiling, basting
them once in a while with a little melted butter.
When they are dished pour a little rich
brown gravy over them. And with them
cooked in this way serve a potato omelet.
Pardon the digression, and I will tell you how
this is made. It may not prove a digression,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>204]</a></span>
however, as it is quite possible that you had a
sufficient quantity of mashed potato left from
the Thanksgiving Day dinner to make it.
But if you didn&rsquo;t, boil four large potatoes
and when soft mash them; beat four eggs
with a cup of milk, mix it with the potatoes
and season with salt and white pepper. Cut
four or five ounces of bacon into tiny squares,
fry till crisp and brown, then mix in the
potatoes and stir over the fire till they are
heated through. Let brown well, fold the
omelet over and serve.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Minced
Turkey with
Mushrooms</div>

<p>If there is a considerable quantity of the
white meat of the turkey left over cut it up
into dice-shaped bits and add to it half its
quantity of canned mushrooms cut in two;
moisten well with b&eacute;chamel sauce, season with
pepper and salt and let heat for ten minutes,
but don&rsquo;t stir it. Dish it on triangular pieces
of toasted white bread. Or, if you like, you
may use in place of the b&eacute;chamel sauce, cream
and butter; but, whatever amount of cream is
used, let it heat till it reduces to one-half.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Minced
Turkey</div>

<p>A more savory hash may be made in this
way: Use any or all bits of the turkey and
chop them rather finely; add a little chopped
parsley, a few drops of lemon juice, the juice
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>205]</a></span>
of an onion or two, and white stock enough
to moisten it sufficiently. Let it simmer for
half an hour very slowly and then add a
little white wine just before taking up. If
you are in the habit of using wine in cooking
you will know all about how much it will
require to give just the right flavor; but if
you are pledged to abstain from such practices
you won&rsquo;t want to know and you won&rsquo;t need
to know how much should be used, so I&rsquo;ll
not go into particulars.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Goose Pie</div>

<p>But perhaps for good and sufficient reasons
you didn&rsquo;t have turkey at all but had roasted
goose, and if that is so please do use up the
tidbits by making a goose pie. Cut all the
meat from the bones and put the bones with
the skin into a saucepan with a little water to
boil slowly for two hours. Let it cool, and
skim off all the fat; into the bottom of a deep
dish put a scanty layer of boiled and mashed
onions; sprinkle well with salt and pepper,
put in a layer of the goose meat, then a
layer of the onions, and so on till the dish
is filled. Pour in the water in which the
bones were boiled, cover with a good crust
and bake in a moderate oven till the crust
is done.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Stewed
Goose</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>206]</a></span>
Let me tell you also that stewed goose is
by no means a slow sort of dish. In fact, it
is reckoned by a good many as being among
the joys of earth. Take two onions, peel
and chop, and put them in a saucepan with
a tablespoonful of butter and fry until soft;
dredge them with flour and stir in half a
pint or so of the water in which the bones of
the goose have been boiled. Cut up into
dice-shaped pieces any or all of the cold
cooked goose and put it into the saucepan
with a wineglass of white wine and a tablespoonful
of vinegar, and season to taste with salt
and pepper. Cover closely and stew for half
an hour slowly. Turn out and serve very hot.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Baked
Squash</div>

<p>It is more than probable that, whatever
else you had for dinner, you saw fit to
have in addition squash boiled and mashed.
And it is safe to say that some of it was
left. So take this remnant and heat it well
with plenty of butter over the fire and then
put it into a baking dish. Scatter Parmesan
cheese over the top and brown it very quickly
in a hot oven. Serve this with your stewed
goose, and the trick is yours.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Broiled
Duck Fillets
with Orange
Sauce</div>

<p>And suppose you had ducks for your dinner,
could you find a better way than this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>207]</a></span>
to serve up what was left of them? Cut as
good-sized pieces as you can and dip them
in a little melted butter; season with pepper
and salt, and broil for a minute or so over
a hot fire. Arrange the pieces on a hot
dish and pour over them a sauce made in
this way: Fry two or three slices of fat
bacon and an onion together for five minutes;
add the juice of an orange and a wineglass
of port or sherry wine with what salt
and pepper is needed. Strain it before
using. You will find this so delectable, I
dare say, that you will be ready to declare
that the last days of those ducks were better
than the first.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Duck Salad</div>

<p>Did you ever make a duck salad in this
way? Rub the bottom of the salad bowl
with a peeled onion, and squeeze in a few
drops of lemon juice. Put the cold bits of
duck in the bowl with what you consider a
suitable amount of chopped whites of boiled
eggs; over this sprinkle a few quartered
olives and a handful or so of capers, and
then put in a layer of chopped watercresses.
Cover this with a layer of mayonnaise and
serve. Now if you want to use a little
turkey meat, or a little goose meat, or a little
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>208]</a></span>
of each, to eke out what you have of cold duck,
go right ahead and do so. The salad will be
just as good as when duck alone is used and
perhaps some will think it even better.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Fish Salad</div>

<p>Didn&rsquo;t you have a boiled or even a
broiled fish of some kind for your dinner,
either halibut, striped bass, or fresh cod?
If you did, just take what was left of it and
flake it up daintily; put a layer of it in a
salad bowl that has been rubbed with an
onion, sprinkle the fish with salt and lemon
juice, put in a layer of shredded lettuce, dressing
this also with lemon juice and salt, another
layer of the fish and lastly one of lettuce.
Cover it all with a layer of tartar sauce, and
there you have a salad worth the eating.
&rsquo;Twouldn&rsquo;t tempt a dying anchorite, perhaps,
but it&rsquo;s quite good enough for human nature&rsquo;s
daily food.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;<i>And we meet, with champagne and chicken, at last.</i>&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
</div>


<p><span class="dropcap">A</span>NY one can go to market if she has
the wherewithal and secure any kind
of game that happens to be on the list
and be happy in the purchase and eating of
it, I dare say. But the happiest dames in these
times are those who have a husband or sweetheart
in the field shooting straight to the
mark with all thoughts for the recipient of his
day&rsquo;s work. So it comes to pass that by express
to many a door there come on these
fine crisp mornings boxes or hampers of game
birds. The next thing, of course, is to get
one&rsquo;s neighbors in to partake of them in order
that they may be set by the ears with envy.
I am with you. I will help you to make this
envy business complete while you are about it.</p>

<p>There shall be a dinner given&mdash;a dinner
which by a wise and palatable arrangement of
courses shall lead up to the game.</p>

<p>Now, you know all about scallops, of
course&mdash;and by &ldquo;all&rdquo; you mean fried and
served with tartar sauce. Bah! to you and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>210]</a></span>
your stereotyped dishes. Novelty I beg of
you, and then put in your way the means
to do as I beg. Do you appreciate it, I
wonder? I doubt it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Scallops in
Shells</div>

<p>Well, then, scallops after the bouillon.
Cook them in a little white wine till you
know they are done. Then drain, cut them
in halves or in quarters and add to them
half their quantity of minced onion fried till
tender, but not brown. Moisten with a little
white sauce, season with cayenne and salt,
heap in scallop shells, cover with bread-crumbs
moistened with melted butter and brown in
the hottest oven you can arrange.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Salmi of
Cold
Partridge</div>

<p>Whereas it is agreed that the pleasure of a
repast must be continuous&mdash;not jerky&mdash;let
us plan for the next dish at your luncheon
salmis of partridge, cold. The birds must be
roasted and then cooled. Cut them into neat
pieces, removing all the skin. Boil the skin
and all the odd bits in a little red wine and
water. Season with salt and a bay-leaf and
thicken after it has boiled five minutes with
a little flour braided with butter. Take it
off, lift out all the pieces of meat and add
enough aspic jelly to stiffen it. Set on ice
and beat till stiff, then dip into it the neatly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>211]</a></span>
trimmed pieces of partridge. Dress them on
a dish, using chop frills for the legs and set
on ice till the time comes for serving.</p>

<p>At this sort of a luncheon you know you
must have two dishes of game and to let the
first one be cold is doing the matter up as not
one neighbor in ten of yours would think of
doing.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Chicken Liver
Patties</div>

<p>Now for the next link in this gastronomical
harmony. Let it be chicken liver patties.
You know how to make the puff paste and
how to line the pans with it. Then you cook
the desired number of chicken livers till tender,
drain off the water, cover them with a rich
Spanish sauce in which are as many sliced
truffles as your means will allow. Of course
this must be hot when the patty pans are
filled with it and then the patties must be hot
when they go to table.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Roasted Teal</div>

<p>Now make way for the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pi&egrave;ce de r&eacute;sistance</i>.
What shall it be? He sent you blue-winged
teal duck, you say? Couldn&rsquo;t be better.
His intentions towards you are of the best,
you may depend. His blue-winged teal go
where his heart is every time, let me tell you.
Into each bird you will put a slice or two of
toasted bread which has been soaked in any
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>212]</a></span>
red wine. Rub the inside of the bird well
with salt. Roast in a piping hot oven for
twenty minutes, basting five times with melted
butter. Garnish with sliced lemon when
serving.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Tomatoes
Stuffed with
Mayonnaise
and Celery</div>

<p>You will want tomato with celery and
mayonnaise for this course, you know.
Have large, firm, fine tomatoes peeled carefully.
Then cut a round out of the top
of each and scoop out all the seeds. Keep
the round whole, by the way. Fill each
tomato with celery chopped and mixed with
mayonnaise. Clap on the top in which you
have cut a tiny hole in the centre and in
this hole stick a little sprig of tender green
celery.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Macaroon
Custards</div>

<p>Only macaroon custards are good enough
to be served at this point and these you make
by covering half a pound of macaroons with
hot cream first. When cool, beat well. Then
add the yolks and whites beaten separately of
six eggs and a tablespoonful of brandy. Butter
some moulds, fill with the mixture and bake
for ten minutes. Unmould on lace paper
before serving. Yes, of course, have them
cold. Who wants hot custard?</p>

<p>For a drink? Cider cup. Not here, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>213]</a></span>
elsewhere, a page or two away, will you find
directions for making this decoction.</p>

<hr class="break" />

<p>A few pages back I related an account of
some of the happenings of my trip to market
in search of game birds of the smaller kinds.
Appended to this recital were given in a more
or less appetizing fashion a few directions for
preparing the birds which it seemed to me
must find favor with epicures and laymen
alike; and, assuming that approval was accorded
these recipes, of which some were
begged, others borrowed and more stolen, I
am giving herewith hints for use in the
preparation of the larger birds to be had
now, with honors easy as to quantity and
quality. As to price, you may pay what you
will, almost, from seventy-five cents up to
three and four and even five dollars per pair.</p>

<p>To begin with, there are the toothsome
canvas-backs that lead in price and palate-tickling
properties. Now, I know quite as
well as you that not every one who pleases
may dine from canvas-back when fancy dictates;
in fact, with nine out of ten
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>214]</a></span>
householders something very like a dispute takes
place between the purse and the palate in
every instance where canvas-back forms the
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pi&egrave;ce de r&eacute;sistance</i> at dinner. But the next
time the palate wins in the debate go straightway
to market and secure its indulgence
from a marketman who will give you his
oath that the canvas-backs he has on sale
have fed on the banks where the wild celery
grows, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>, along the Gunpowder River, a
tributary of the Chesapeake Bay, and you
may feel sure that you have the best the
market affords.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Broiled
Canvas-back</div>

<p>As to the cooking. Wasn&rsquo;t it that
wholly delightful old Colonel Carter who
laid it down as a law that to smother a
canvas-back in jelly of any sort or description
was little short of criminal? And that
he was right there are scores of persons
devoted to the art of good living ready to
attest. No; if you are to have the bird
broiled, use a double-broiler, leave over the
fire ten minutes, eight will be better, and
serve with only a little melted butter having
in it a soup&ccedil;on of lemon juice. There is
nothing there, you see, to encroach upon
the delicate flavor of the duck. About two
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>215]</a></span>
minutes before removing from the fire
sprinkle a little salt over the bird.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Roasted
Canvas-back,
Port Wine
Sauce</div>

<p>But if a roast of game seems to you
better calculated to round out your dinner
scheme, then roast them, but don&rsquo;t have
them too well done (&rsquo;tis said the blood should
follow the knife); and for a sauce have some
port wine heated in a bain-marie with a few
drops of orange juice added thereto. H&rsquo;m,
talk about being able to tempt a dying
anchorite! Sydney Smith may have thought
it a great height attained to concoct a salad
calculated to make that abstemious old recluse
dip his fingers in the salad bowl, but for me,
I&rsquo;d a thousand times rather prepare a dish fit
to tickle the palate of a gourmet who is somewhat
aweary of good things; and I fancy that
canvas-back so roasted and served is quite
capable of lending a fillip to the existence of
those most experienced in the joys to be found
in eating.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s very sad, but it&rsquo;s also very true, that
there are instances where a redhead duck is
foisted upon an unknowing and consequently
unsuspecting purchaser in place of a canvas-back.
This is easily done, because of the
strong resemblance between them as to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>216]</a></span>
plumage and habits, for the two kinds fly
and feed in the same flock. But while the
flavor of the redhead is of a desirable quality,
it in no way approaches that of the canvas-back.</p>

<p>In the cooking of the redhead duck, the
rules given for preparing canvas-backs may be
followed, with the exceptions that in the
melted butter used for the broiled bird a little
minced parsley will be an improvement, and
in the port wine sauce for the roasted duck
currant jelly may be melted and impart a
flavor that will be generally liked.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Roasted
Mallard Duck
with
Fried Celery</div>

<p>A favorite duck with many good diners is
the mallard, and when they are in good condition
they are quite worthy the favor shown
them. It is only a matter of choice whether
they shall be roasted or broiled; if the latter
way is decided upon, then a garnishing of
fried celery makes a tempting dish more
tempting still. Only the tender, smallest
stocks of celery should be used, and then,
after being dipped in frying batter, they
should be fried quickly in butter. These
birds, and, in fact, all others, when being
broiled or roasted, should not be salted till
about two minutes before removing from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>217]</a></span>
fire. If the salt is put on earlier the meat is
apt to be tough and the quality of the flavor
somewhat injured. I don&rsquo;t know that cookery
books give this direction explicitly, but I
have found from experience that it is the case.</p>

<p>If you are to have your mallards roasted,
then by all means make a sour-apple marmalade,
strain it through a sieve and add to it
half its quantity of unsweetened whipped
cream. If you have never tried this sauce
with roasted duck, then, my word for it, there
is a gastronomical delight waiting for you, and
I wouldn&rsquo;t advise you to keep it waiting long,
for you will be the loser.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t you recognize in this sauce an old
friend in a new dress? Why, of course,
roast duck and apple sauce is a dish our great-grandmothers
were fond of; but this latter-day
manner of preparing the sauce, you see,
idealizes it a bit and renders it so much the
daintier.</p>

<p>Another duck of delectable flavor is the
ruddy duck, or broadbill, as it is known in
some localities. They live in the fresh ponds
hereabouts, and as long as the ponds remain
unfrozen the ducks will be quite satisfied with
this climate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>218]</a></span>
Teal ducks, too, especially the blue-winged,
are of excellent flavor, and, in addition to this,
the meat is said to be highly nutritious and
easily digested, making them desirable for
convalescents. There is also a green-winged
teal, but it is far inferior to the first-mentioned
variety.</p>

<p>One cannot very well decide upon the particular
kind of game and the manner in which
it shall be served without giving some thought
to the salad that in reality acts as its supplement.
And the same rule which forbids the
serving of a rich, heavy sauce with game
applies to salads. The simpler the salad the
more keenly will you relish the game.
Chopped celery, lettuce, chicory, watercress
or cucumbers, with a simple French dressing,
are the salads <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">par excellence</i> to be served with
game.</p>

<p>By the way, not long ago some one
wrote to a certain weekly published in New
York asking if it was &ldquo;good form&rdquo; to serve
the game and the salad on the same plate.
It doesn&rsquo;t seem to me to be a matter in any
way to be governed by what is called &ldquo;good
form.&rdquo; Good taste and a very superficial
knowledge of epicureanism would enable their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>219]</a></span>
possessor to understand that hot game should
be hot, not lukewarm, and that the salads
should be cold, and the only way to accomplish
this is to have a plate for each.</p>

<hr class="break" />

<div class="sidenote">Sardine
Canap&eacute;</div>

<p>Cut some slices of bread from a not too
fresh loaf, trim them to an oblong shape,
remove all crust and toast a delicate brown.
Into a pat of butter mix some finely chopped
parsley, pepper and lemon juice, in suitable
proportions, and with the mixture coat the
slices of toast. Remove the skin and bones
from the desired number of sardines and lay
them on the toast; garnish between the sardines
with hard-boiled eggs, chopped very
finely, the whites and yolks separately.
Sprinkle over all some minced parsley and
there you have a canap&eacute;&mdash;a sardine canap&eacute;&mdash;one
of the most delightful appetizers known
to good diners of this day and generation.
Moreover it is a fitting beginning for a
Christmas dinner of the kind which I am
about to submit for your approval.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Chicken
Consomm&eacute;</div>

<p>The wisdom of following the canap&eacute; with
the simplest soup possible will be quite apparent,
if I mistake not, some time before the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>220]</a></span>
dinner is a thing of the past. Why not,
therefore, prepare it in this way? Take a
chicken, cut it in pieces and put it into a
saucepan with two quarts of water to simmer
gently until the scum begins to rise,
skim until every particle is removed, then add
salt, a carrot, an onion, two slices of turnip
and three celery stalks. Boil gently for two
hours, strain and serve, and your family and
guests will have reason to bless the hour when
you set before them a chicken consomm&eacute;.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Oysters
Baked with
Cheese</div>

<p>After the soup? Well, suppose you lay
in a deep dish fit to be placed in the oven
a bed of medium-sized oysters; season them
with salt, pepper, and a few small pieces of
butter; sift over them some fresh bread-crumbs
and pour in a little sherry with some
of the oyster liquor; repeat the same operation
until the dish is full, then besprinkle the
whole with bread-crumbs; scatter small pats
of butter here and there, and set the dish in a
hot oven for fifteen minutes to color a light
brown, then serve, and serving be modestly
proud of the fact that you have prepared a
dish which sometimes appears upon the menu
at Delmonico&rsquo;s as &ldquo;<span  lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Hu&icirc;tres au Gratin &agrave; la

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>221]</a></span>
lunching or dining at that hostelry and compare
your effort with that of the famous chef
at Delmonico&rsquo;s. For your sake, as well as
for my own, I trust that you will find that
the success turned out by your own cuisine
gains by the comparison.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Goose
Stuffed with
Potato</div>

<p>Are you still wavering in your opinion as
to whether your choice shall fall on turkey,
ducks or goose for the Christmas dinner?
Let it be goose then, for if properly cooked
and served they go far toward clinching the
success of the feast. But &ldquo;properly cooked
and served,&rdquo; there&rsquo;s the rub. And isn&rsquo;t it
enough to amaze a contemplative person to
note how wide apart are the conditions which
different housekeepers define by that phrase?
Nevertheless I am going to tell you how it
seems to me a goose should be prepared to
answer the description. If the bird is of
medium size then you will want to boil and
mash eight or ten large potatoes; to them
add half a dozen small onions which have
been peeled and chopped as finely as possible;
then season with white pepper and salt to
taste. Add at least half a pint of cream or
rich milk, about three ounces of melted butter,
and three eggs beaten to a froth. Whip the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>222]</a></span>
potato till it is light and smooth and fill the
inside of the goose with it. When it is sent
to the table have it garnished with very small
onions which have been boiled till tender
without losing their shape, and then fried a
light brown in butter. Nothing can be better
for a sauce than the giblets boiled till tender,
then chopped finely and returned to the
water in which they were boiled, with a little
Madeira, and a gill of button mushrooms cut
in halves; thicken with a tablespoonful of
browned flour braided with an equal quantity
of butter.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Turnips with
Butter Sauce</div>

<p>Although there may be in market a goodly
showing of vegetables from almost every part
of the country, not everything is calculated to
supplement the flavor of roasted goose so
well as is a sweet and well-flavored turnip.
Particularly is this the case if the turnips are
cut into fanciful shapes, such as dice, crescents,
etc., with the vegetable cutters, which come

<div class="sidenote">Victoria
Sorbet</div>

<p>Perhaps there are some housekeepers who
will think I should suggest an entr&eacute;e to follow
the goose, but at this season of the year
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>223]</a></span>
I am trying to live up to the golden rule, and
as at this point I should vastly prefer a punch
or a sorbet to anything else, I am going to
recommend that you be guided by my preference.
You may take one quart of lemon
water ice to which has been added the whites
of three eggs beaten to a froth, a gill of kirsch
and half a pint of champagne, and send to
table in some of the pretty punch cups which
formed one of your Yule-tide gifts. You
may also serve cigarettes at the same time,
and, my word for it, your guests at table
assembled will have a keener appetite for
the next course than if you had sandwiched
in some rich entr&eacute;e.</p>

<p>With about nine out of every ten suburbanites
raising pigeons in these days it is
very easy to understand why the squabs in
the market are of such good quality and
are sold at such a reasonable price. And
under these circumstances don&rsquo;t you think
they will be excellent for the next course if
broiled to a turn and accompanied by a
salad of chicory or watercress?</p>

<p>After the squabs the sweets. Few housekeepers
will think a Christmas dinner complete
without mince pies and plum-pudding,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>224]</a></span>
but I cannot suggest a way in which to
make them, for truth to tell, I never prepared
either, and I&rsquo;m above offering you
any recipes which I&rsquo;ve not tried, no matter
how true they may be. Consult your cookery
books if you&rsquo;ve not a favorite method of
your own for preparing these aids to indigestion,
and select those that seem least harmful.</p>

<p>Of course, there will be upon the table till
dessert is served celery, olives stuffed or plain,
salted almonds or pecans, etc. I know that
you know this, but had I neglected to mention
it more than likely you would have
accused me of being ignorant of the necessity
of having these side dishes at a dinner.</p>

<p>After the sweets the biscuit, cheese and
coffee, and if the cheese is to be of a particularly
rich flavor, such as Camembert,
Roquefort, or Brie, then by all means serve
with it some of the little Bar-le-Duc currants,
both red and white.</p>

<p>Are you to have wine? Then make it
sherry with the soup, champagne with the
goose, and the very best burgundy to be had
to accompany the squabs.</p>

<p>I fancy there is nothing more that I can suggest
that will add to your happiness or that of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>225]</a></span>
your guests, who will probably feel very
grateful to you for spreading for them a
feast &ldquo;delectable to eat and to behold.&rdquo; For
yourself, you will probably feel very grateful
that Christmas comes but once a year.</p>

<hr class="break" />

<p>You shall not be put off with any side issue
in these very last pages, but shall have dished
up for your critical examination a list that
I promise you shall be a hodge-podge, a
m&eacute;lange, or, if it please your sense of the
fitness of things better, a mac&eacute;doine of the
best edibles the market affords.</p>

<p>Doubtless when you have been in Western
cities you have dined many a time and oft at
those sky-high restaurants overlooking one of
the Great Lakes, and have had the waiter, with
an air of honesty made perfect by practice,
point out to you the very spot where the whitefish
you were at the minute admiring had been
pulled in scarcely three hours before. If so,
you know the delicious and unapproachable
flavor of the fish in their purest and best
estate. And yet they reach eastern markets
in a remarkable state of freshness and are
inexpensive enough to warrant any one in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>226]</a></span>
trying them for a change from the kinds that
are more common here.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Baked
Whitefish</div>

<p>Broiled over a hot fire and served with a
simple sauce made of melted butter, lemon
juice and a sprinkling of cayenne they are
good enough to serve at any meal for anybody.
But you can make a more elaborate
dish from them by going to work in this way:
Scale a rather good-sized fish, split it, remove
the backbone, and then season the fish well
with salt and pepper, dip it in beaten egg,
then in bread-crumbs, again in beaten egg,
and lay in a well buttered baking pan.
Bake in a hot oven till it is colored a good
brown. Take it up on a hot dish, set the
baking pan having in it the hot butter on the
top of the range and cook in it for a minute
or two half a pint of drained oysters; arrange
the oysters round the fish and pour a little
melted butter over all, with a garnishing of
fried parsley. If you are having this dish for
luncheon, have with it some potato croquettes,
but if it is intended for dinner and a roast or
rich entr&eacute;e is to follow, then have a dainty
salad of crisp radishes with a handful of capers
shaken over them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Boiled Cods&rsquo;
Tongues</div>

<p>And now is the time if ever that fresh cods&rsquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>227]</a></span>
tongues should find favor. They are inexpensive
and in perfect condition, and by
more than one gourmet are considered an
unrivalled delicacy. If this statement persuades
you to give them a trial, just a word
as to preparing them: Have three pints of
water boiling in a saucepan, add to it two
carrots and half a dozen onions very finely
chopped, a few sprigs of parsley and two gills
of vinegar. When the vegetables are nearly
tender enough put into the saucepan with
them two pounds of cods&rsquo; tongues. Let them
boil just once, then move back where they
will simmer but not boil for twenty minutes
or so. Take up the tongues, drain, dress
them on a hot dish and keep hot while you
prepare the sauce. For this drain the vegetables
and toss them about in a frying-pan
in plenty of butter till they show signs of
browning a bit, then add to them some chopped
cucumber pickles and a few capers and
pour round the tongues. Season the sauce,
of course, with salt and pepper, and if you
are gifted with rare discretion in the matter of
spices use ever so little nutmeg in it; just one
or two turns of the grater will give you all
you should have. I intend to be very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>228]</a></span>
particular in my choice of readers and hearers
when I suggest the use of nutmeg in savory
sauces, because there are so many housekeepers
as well as cooks who positively are
not to be trusted with a nutmeg in one hand
and a grater in the other; they will persist in
going on the principle that if a little is good
more must be better, and then grate away for
dear life.</p>

<p>Of course you know that smelts are in their
prime, but is your sense of smell keen enough
to detect in that fish the likeness of its fragrance
to that of the violet or of the cucumber?
Well, the similarity is there if the fish
be as fresh as it should, and if you don&rsquo;t discover
it you may add another to your list of
misfortunes, for they do say, those who know
whereof they speak, that inability to perceive
this subtle scent indicates a correspondingly
unappreciative palate. And so much for my
fish story.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Fried
Partridge
Breasts</div>

<p>Along with the many things for which we
have cause for rejoicing about this time of
year there should certainly be reckoned the
fact that game of almost all kinds is more
plentiful and less expensive than at other
seasons. And you know that under such
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>229]</a></span>
favorable circumstances as these I am wont
to urge you to make experiments in preparing
the viand in question. Suppose, for
instance, that the next time you are to have
partridges you pretend to forget that these
birds are ever roasted or broiled, and so set
to work to serve them in this way: Have
four partridges, cut off the breasts, divide them
in two and lay them aside; boil the legs and
livers of the birds in salted water till they
are quite tender&mdash;so tender, in fact, that they
can be pressed through a rather coarse sieve.
Put this pulp into a saucepan with a gill of
the water used for boiling it, half a gill of
sherry wine, a bit of cayenne, an ounce of
butter, and salt if it is needed. Let this get
hot, very hot, without boiling, and keep it
hot while you cook the breasts. These fry
in butter and range in a circle on a dish with
alternate slices of bread also fried in butter,
and in the centre pour the sauce made from
the legs and livers. To be sure, you can
make the sauce somewhat richer by adding to
it chopped mushrooms or chopped truffles or
both.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Roasted
Quails</div>

<p>Forget, also, for a time, your favorite ways
of cooking quails in order that you may
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>230]</a></span>
pronounce judgment on this manner of preparing
them: Have half a dozen of them drawn
and singed for roasting. Chop up the livers,
double the quantity of chicken liver and as
much minced fat salt pork as liver; add
chopped parsley, salt, cayenne, three or four
drops of onion juice, a tablespoonful of very
fine bread-crumbs, and one beaten egg. Mix
these ingredients all well together and fill
the quails with it; roast them in a rather
moderate oven for twenty minutes, basting
occasionally with melted butter. Dress the
quails on a hot dish, squeeze a few drops of
lemon juice into the pan in which they were
roasted, adding a little melted butter, and
pour this sauce over the birds.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Roasted
Duck
Stuffed with
Celery</div>

<p>Or it may be that for yourself you prefer a
roasted black duck, but cannot gratify your
preference because some members of the
family will insist upon calling such a bird
&ldquo;strong,&rdquo; when you know and speak of the
flavor only as being &ldquo;gamey.&rdquo; Now, there&rsquo;s
a way out of the difficulty for all of you. Just
stuff the birds as full as you can with celery
tops, tie thin slices of fat salt pork over
their breasts and roast them till they are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>231]</a></span>
quite tender and brown. You will find the
strong flavor entirely gone, while the gamey
taste will be so aided and abetted by the
celery that your palate will receive a new
and altogether delightful sensation. Surround
the ducks when serving with a border prepared
as follows: Brown some slices of bread
in the oven, and when of a good color and
very dry, roll and pass through a fine sieve,
mix these crumbs with a little butter, season
them with salt and pepper and heat well in
the oven before using. Serve with the ducks
also a hot apple sauce; make it as you always
do and add to one pint of sauce an ounce of
butter.</p>

<p>With either of the ways suggested for cooking
game you will want to serve a salad,
probably, and you can&rsquo;t do better than
decide to have one of escarole or of romaine
with a simple French dressing. But there
is chicory, of course, and there is lettuce,
and both of them in fine condition, if you
don&rsquo;t feel inclined to take my advice. And
there are cucumbers, from hothouses, and
there are hothouse tomatoes, that are
expensive or the reverse, according to one&rsquo;s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>232]</a></span>
position on the financial question. In fact,
you can get almost any kind of vegetable
or fruit in the large markets to-day, and at
all times; and if the particular thing that
you desire happens to be absent, just wait
a few minutes and your order will be filled
by lightning express from some part of the
world.</p>

<p><b>Transcriber&rsquo;s Note</b></p>

<p>The table of contents has been added by the transcriber for the
convenience of the reader.</p>

<p>Minor punctuation errors have been repaired.</p>

<p>Several terms appear variously with a hyphen or a space&mdash;bread-crumbs and bread
crumbs, chafing-dish and chafing dish, egg-plant and egg plant, horse-radish and
horse radish, etc. These are preserved as printed. Hyphenation has otherwise been
made consistent.</p>

<p>The author uses some variant spelling, for example, cura&ccedil;oa or bran new. There are
also some inconsistencies&mdash;omelet and omelette, souffl&eacute; and souffl&eacute;e,
piquant and piquante. These are all preserved as printed.</p>

<p>There are some small inconsistencies between recipe names in the main body of the book and
those in the index. These are all preserved as printed.</p>

<p>On page <a href="#Page_29">29</a>, the word chevril (a type of horse tea) occurred. As it
appeared in a paragraph referencing several herbs as seasoning, it has
been amended to chervil, on the assumption that that was actually the
intended word.</p>

<p>On page <a href="#Page_216">216</a> is the phrase &ldquo;tender, smallest stocks of celery.&rdquo; This
may be an error for &ldquo;stalks of celery,&rdquo; or it could be that the
intention was to refer to a store of celery or the availability of
it. As there is no way to sure, it is preserved as printed.</p>

Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
